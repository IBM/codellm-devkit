# :kolena-classification-16: Uploading Custom Embeddings

This guide explains how to upload your own embeddings to Kolena using the Kolena SDK.
Please ensure you have the SDK installed.
[Instructions for installing the SDK are available here.](https://docs.kolena.com/installing-kolena/)

## Step 1: Import the Embedding Upload Function

To upload embeddings, use the `upload_dataset_embeddings` function from Kolena. You can import
it with the following code:
```python
from kolena._experimental.search import upload_dataset_embeddings
```

## Step 2: Prepare the Required DataFrame

The DataFrame you upload should have:

- Unique Identifier Columns: This is typically the `locator` field, which serves as a unique identifier for each entry.
 Could be multiple id fields combined together like `locator` + `person_id`
- Embedding Column: Each embedding must have the same size across all rows.

### Example code

Hereâ€™s an example where we download the `instance-seg` dataset from Kolena,
then add a placeholder embedding (a random array):
```python
import numpy as np
from kolena.dataset import download_dataset

dataset = "instance-seg"
df = download_dataset(dataset)
df_embedding = df[["locator"]]
df_embedding["embedding"] = [np.random.random((512,)) for _ in range(len(df_embedding))]
```
!!! Note
    Replace the placeholder embeddings with embeddings generated from your own embedding model.

## Step 3: Upload the DataFrame using Kolena SDK

With the DataFrame prepared, use the `upload_dataset_embeddings` function to upload it to Kolena.

```python
upload_dataset_embeddings(dataset_name="instance-seg", key="my-embedding-model", df_embedding=df_embedding)
```

The `dataset_name` parameter specifies the target dataset where the embeddings will be uploaded.
The key parameter is a unique identifier for the embeddings being uploaded, allowing multiple embeddings
 to be associated with the same dataset. Finally, `df_embeddings` is the DataFrame object
 prepared in Step 2 that contains the data you want to upload.

## Step 4: Verify Your Embeddings in Kolena Studio

To confirm the embeddings uploaded successfully:

- Open Kolena Studio.
- In the top right corner, click on "Off" beside the embeddings toggle to enable embeddings view.
- Select the embedding model key saved in the upload function. In the example it was `my-embedding-model`.
- Choose from the visualization options: UMAP, t-SNE, or PCA.
