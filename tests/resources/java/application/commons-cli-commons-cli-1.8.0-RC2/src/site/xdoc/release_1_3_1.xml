INTRODUCTION:

This document contains the release notes for this version of the Commons CLI
package. Commons CLI provides a simple API for working with the command line
arguments and options.

Commons CLI 1.3.1 is a bug fix release and binary compatible with the
previous versions, except for the OptionValidator class that is no longer public
(change introduced in v1.2). Commons CLI 1.3.1 at least requires Java 5.0.

More information can be found on the project site at
https://commons.apache.org/cli.

BUG FIXES
