This directory contains MPW scripts and related files that are needed to
build Cygnus GNU tools for MPW.

"tr-7to8-src" is actually the source to an MPW script that transforms
sequences like "\Option-d" into the actual 8-bit chars that MPW needs.
It's only the source because it can't itself include any 8-bit chars.
It *can* be processed into a genuine "tr-7to8" by using itself:

	tr-7to8 tr-7to8-src | sed -e 's/Src//' >new-tr-7to8

Use this to verify:

	compare tr-7to8 new-tr-7to8

If you don't have a working tr-7to8, then you will have to manually
replace all occurrences of "\Option-d" with real Option-d (which looks
like a delta), then do similarly with all the other "\Option-..."
strings, and then change "\SrcOption-d" into the string "\Option-d".
