SECTION
	Architectures

	BFD keeps one atom in a BFD describing the
	architecture of the data attached to the BFD: a pointer to a
	<<bfd_arch_info_type>>.  

	Pointers to structures can be requested independently of a BFD
	so that an architecture's information can be interrogated
	without access to an open BFD.

	The architecture information is provided by each architecture package.
	The set of default architectures is selected by the macro
	<<SELECT_ARCHITECTURES>>.  This is normally set up in the
	@file{config/@var{target}.mt} file of your choice.  If the name is not
	defined, then all the architectures supported are included. 

	When BFD starts up, all the architectures are called with an
	initialize method.  It is up to the architecture back end to
	insert as many items into the list of architectures as it wants to;
	generally this would be one for each machine and one for the
	default case (an item with a machine field of 0). 

	BFD's idea of an architecture is implemented in	@file{archures.c}.

SUBSECTION
	bfd_architecture

DESCRIPTION
	This enum gives the object file's CPU architecture, in a
	global sense---i.e., what processor family does it belong to?
	Another field indicates which processor within
	the family is in use.  The machine gives a number which
	distinguishes different versions of the architecture,
	containing, for example, 2 and 3 for Intel i960 KA and i960 KB,
	and 68020 and 68030 for Motorola 68020 and 68030.
