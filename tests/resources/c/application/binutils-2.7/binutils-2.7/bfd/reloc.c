SECTION
	Relocations

	BFD maintains relocations in much the same way it maintains
	symbols: they are left alone until required, then read in
	en-mass and translated into an internal form.  A common
	routine <<bfd_perform_relocation>> acts upon the
	canonical form to do the fixup.

	Relocations are maintained on a per section basis,
	while symbols are maintained on a per BFD basis.

	All that a back end has to do to fit the BFD interface is to create
	a <<struct reloc_cache_entry>> for each relocation
	in a particular section, and fill in the right bits of the structures.

/*
DESCRIPTION

        Here is a description of each of the fields within an <<arelent>>:

        o <<sym_ptr_ptr>>

        The symbol table pointer points to a pointer to the symbol
        associated with the relocation request.  It is
        the pointer into the table returned by the back end's
        <<get_symtab>> action. @xref{Symbols}. The symbol is referenced
        through a pointer to a pointer so that tools like the linker
        can fix up all the symbols of the same name by modifying only
        one pointer. The relocation routine looks in the symbol and
        uses the base of the section the symbol is attached to and the
        value of the symbol as the initial relocation offset. If the
        symbol pointer is zero, then the section provided is looked up.

        o <<address>>

        The <<address>> field gives the offset in bytes from the base of
        the section data which owns the relocation record to the first
        byte of relocatable information. The actual data relocated
        will be relative to this point; for example, a relocation
        type which modifies the bottom two bytes of a four byte word
        would not touch the first byte pointed to in a big endian
        world.
	
	o <<addend>>

	The <<addend>> is a value provided by the back end to be added (!)
	to the relocation offset. Its interpretation is dependent upon
	the howto. For example, on the 68k the code:


|        char foo[];
|        main()
|                {
|                return foo[0x12345678];
|                }

        Could be compiled into:

|        linkw fp,#-4
|        moveb @@#12345678,d0
|        extbl d0
|        unlk fp
|        rts


        This could create a reloc pointing to <<foo>>, but leave the
        offset in the data, something like:


|RELOCATION RECORDS FOR [.text]:
|offset   type      value
|00000006 32        _foo
|
|00000000 4e56 fffc          ; linkw fp,#-4
|00000004 1039 1234 5678     ; moveb @@#12345678,d0
|0000000a 49c0               ; extbl d0
|0000000c 4e5e               ; unlk fp
|0000000e 4e75               ; rts


        Using coff and an 88k, some instructions don't have enough
        space in them to represent the full address range, and
        pointers have to be loaded in two parts. So you'd get something like:


|        or.u     r13,r0,hi16(_foo+0x12345678)
|        ld.b     r2,r13,lo16(_foo+0x12345678)
|        jmp      r1


        This should create two relocs, both pointing to <<_foo>>, and with
        0x12340000 in their addend field. The data would consist of:


|RELOCATION RECORDS FOR [.text]:
|offset   type      value
|00000002 HVRT16    _foo+0x12340000
|00000006 LVRT16    _foo+0x12340000
|
|00000000 5da05678           ; or.u r13,r0,0x5678
|00000004 1c4d5678           ; ld.b r2,r13,0x5678
|00000008 f400c001           ; jmp r1


        The relocation routine digs out the value from the data, adds
        it to the addend to get the original offset, and then adds the
        value of <<_foo>>. Note that all 32 bits have to be kept around
        somewhere, to cope with carry from bit 15 to bit 16.

        One further example is the sparc and the a.out format. The
        sparc has a similar problem to the 88k, in that some
        instructions don't have room for an entire offset, but on the
        sparc the parts are created in odd sized lumps. The designers of
        the a.out format chose to not use the data within the section
        for storing part of the offset; all the offset is kept within
        the reloc. Anything in the data should be ignored.

|        save %sp,-112,%sp
|        sethi %hi(_foo+0x12345678),%g2
|        ldsb [%g2+%lo(_foo+0x12345678)],%i0
|        ret
|        restore

        Both relocs contain a pointer to <<foo>>, and the offsets
        contain junk.


|RELOCATION RECORDS FOR [.text]:
|offset   type      value
|00000004 HI22      _foo+0x12345678
|00000008 LO10      _foo+0x12345678
|
|00000000 9de3bf90     ; save %sp,-112,%sp
|00000004 05000000     ; sethi %hi(_foo+0),%g2
|00000008 f048a000     ; ldsb [%g2+%lo(_foo+0)],%i0
|0000000c 81c7e008     ; ret
|00000010 81e80000     ; restore


        o <<howto>>

        The <<howto>> field can be imagined as a
        relocation instruction. It is a pointer to a structure which
        contains information on what to do with all of the other
        information in the reloc record and data section. A back end
        would normally have a relocation instruction set and turn
        relocations into pointers to the correct structure on input -
        but it would be possible to create each howto field on demand.

	If @var{output_bfd} is supplied to this function, the

	copied to the output file after they have been changed to
	reflect the new state of the world. There are two ways of
	reflecting the results of partial linkage in an output file:
	by modifying the output data in place, and by modifying the
	relocation record.  Some native formats (e.g., basic a.out and
	basic coff) have no way of specifying an addend in the
	relocation type, so the addend has to go in the output data.
	This is no big deal since in these formats the output data
	slot will always be big enough for the addend. Complex reloc
	types with addends were invented to solve just this problem.
	The @var{error_message} argument is set to an error message if
	this return @code{bfd_reloc_dangerous}.

If you put a patch like that into BFD you need to check all the COFF
linkers.  I am fairly certain that patch will break coff-i386 (e.g.,
SCO); see coff_i386_reloc in coff-i386.c where I worked around the
problem in a different way.  There may very well be a reason that the
code works as it does.

Hmmm.  The first obvious point is that bfd_perform_relocation should
not have any tests that depend upon the flavour.  It's seem like
entirely the wrong place for such a thing.  The second obvious point
is that the current code ignores the reloc addend when producing
relocateable output for COFF.  That's peculiar.  In fact, I really
have no idea what the point of the line you want to remove is.

A typical COFF reloc subtracts the old value of the symbol and adds in
the new value to the location in the object file (if it's a pc
relative reloc it adds the difference between the symbol value and the
location).  When relocating we need to preserve that property.

BFD handles this by setting the addend to the negative of the old
value of the symbol.  Unfortunately it handles common symbols in a
non-standard way (it doesn't subtract the old value) but that's a
different story (we can't change it without losing backward
compatibility with old object files) (coff-i386 does subtract the old
value, to be compatible with existing coff-i386 targets, like SCO).

So everything works fine when not producing relocateable output.  When
we are producing relocateable output, logically we should do exactly
what we do when not producing relocateable output.  Therefore, your
patch is correct.  In fact, it should probably always just set
reloc_entry->addend to 0 for all cases, since it is, in fact, going to
add the value into the object file.  This won't hurt the COFF code,
which doesn't use the addend; I'm not sure what it will do to other
formats (the thing to check for would be whether any formats both use
the addend and set partial_inplace).

When I wanted to make coff-i386 produce relocateable output, I ran
into the problem that you are running into: I wanted to remove that
line.  Rather than risk it, I made the coff-i386 relocs use a special
function; it's coff_i386_reloc in coff-i386.c.  The function
specifically adds the addend field into the object file, knowing that
bfd_perform_relocation is not going to.  If you remove that line, then
coff-i386.c will wind up adding the addend field in twice.  It's
trivial to fix; it just needs to be done.

The problem with removing the line is just that it may break some
working code.  With BFD it's hard to be sure of anything.  The right
way to deal with this is simply to build and test at least all the
supported COFF targets.  It should be straightforward if time and disk
space consuming.  For each target:
    1) build the linker
    2) generate some executable, and link it using -r (I would
       probably use paranoia.o and link against newlib/libc.a, which
       for all the supported targets would be available in
       /usr/cygnus/progressive/H-host/target/lib/libc.a).
    3) make the change to reloc.c
    4) rebuild the linker
    5) repeat step 2
    6) if the resulting object files are the same, you have at least
       made it no worse
    7) if they are different you have to figure out which version is
       right

FUNCTION

SYNOPSIS
	bfd_reloc_status_type

                        (bfd *abfd,

                         asection *input_section,
			 char **error_message);

DESCRIPTION
	This looks remarkably like <<bfd_perform_relocation>>, except it
	does not expect that the section contents have been filled in.
	I.e., it's suitable for use when creating, rather than applying
	a relocation.

	For now, this function should be considered reserved for the
	assembler.

DESCRIPTION
	The insides of a reloc code.  The idea is that, eventually, there
	will be one enumerator for every type of relocation we ever do.
	Pass one of these values to <<bfd_reloc_type_lookup>>, and it'll
	return a howto pointer.

	This does mean that the application must determine the correct
	enumerator value; you can't get a howto pointer from a random set
	of attributes.

  Some relocations we're using for SPARC V9 -- subject to change.

ENUM
  BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_GPDISP_HI16
ENUMDOC
  Alpha ECOFF and ELF relocations.  Some of these treat the symbol or
     "addend" in some special way.
  For GPDISP_HI16 ("gpdisp") relocations, the symbol is ignored when
     writing; when reading, it will be the absolute section symbol.  The
     addend is the displacement in bytes of the "lda" instruction from
     the "ldah" instruction (which is at the address of this reloc).
ENUM
  BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_GPDISP_LO16
ENUMDOC
  For GPDISP_LO16 ("ignore") relocations, the symbol is handled as
     with GPDISP_HI16 relocs.  The addend is ignored when writing the
     relocations out, and is filled in with the file's GP value on
     reading, for convenience.

ENUM
  BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_GPDISP
ENUMDOC
  The ELF GPDISP relocation is exactly the same as the GPDISP_HI16
     relocation except that there is no accompanying GPDISP_LO16
     relocation.

ENUM
  BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_LITERAL
ENUMX
  BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_LITUSE
ENUMDOC
  The Alpha LITERAL/LITUSE relocs are produced by a symbol reference;
     the assembler turns it into a LDQ instruction to load the address of
     the symbol, and then fills in a register in the real instruction.

     The LITERAL reloc, at the LDQ instruction, refers to the .lita
     section symbol.  The addend is ignored when writing, but is filled
     in with the file's GP value on reading, for convenience, as with the
     GPDISP_LO16 reloc.

     The LITUSE reloc, on the instruction using the loaded address, gives
     information to the linker that it might be able to use to optimize
     away some literal section references.  The symbol is ignored (read
     as the absolute section symbol), and the "addend" indicates the type
     of instruction using the register:
              1 - "memory" fmt insn
              2 - byte-manipulation (byte offset reg)
              3 - jsr (target of branch)

     The GNU linker currently doesn't do any of this optimizing.

ENUM
  BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_HINT
ENUMDOC
  The HINT relocation indicates a value that should be filled into the
     "hint" field of a jmp/jsr/ret instruction, for possible branch-
     prediction logic which may be provided on some processors.

ENUM
  BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_LINKAGE
ENUMDOC
  The LINKAGE relocation outputs a special code in the object file,
     the rest is handled by the linker.

ENUM
  BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_BASEREG
ENUMDOC
  The BASEREG relocation calculates differences to basereg.

ENUM
  BFD_RELOC_MIPS_JMP
ENUMDOC
  Bits 27..2 of the relocation address shifted right 2 bits;
     simple reloc otherwise.

ENUM
  BFD_RELOC_HI16
ENUMDOC
  High 16 bits of 32-bit value; simple reloc.
ENUM
  BFD_RELOC_HI16_S
ENUMDOC
  High 16 bits of 32-bit value but the low 16 bits will be sign
     extended and added to form the final result.  If the low 16
     bits form a negative number, we need to add one to the high value
     to compensate for the borrow when the low bits are added.
ENUM
  BFD_RELOC_LO16
ENUMDOC
  Low 16 bits.
ENUM
  BFD_RELOC_PCREL_HI16_S
ENUMDOC
  Like BFD_RELOC_HI16_S, but PC relative.
ENUM
  BFD_RELOC_PCREL_LO16
ENUMDOC
  Like BFD_RELOC_LO16, but PC relative.

ENUMEQ
  BFD_RELOC_MIPS_GPREL
  BFD_RELOC_GPREL16
ENUMDOC
  Relocation relative to the global pointer.

ENUM
  BFD_RELOC_MIPS_LITERAL
ENUMDOC
  Relocation against a MIPS literal section.
