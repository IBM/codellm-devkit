.SH DESCRIPTION
The GNU 
.B objcopy
utility copies the contents of an object file to another.  
.B objcopy 
uses the GNU BFD Library to read and write the object files.  It can
write the destination object file in a format different from that of
the source object file.  The exact behavior of 
.B objcopy
is controlled by command-line options.
.PP
.B objcopy
creates temporary files to do its translations and deletes them
afterward.
.B objcopy
uses BFD to do all its translation work; it knows about all the
formats BFD knows about, and thus is able to recognize most formats
without being told explicitly.
.PP
.B objcopy
can be used to generate S-records by using an output target of
.B srec
(e.g., use
.B -O srec).
.PP
.B objcopy
can be used to generate a raw binary file by using an output target of
.B binary
(e.g., use
.B -O binary).
When
.B objcopy
generates a raw binary file, it will essentially produce a memory dump
of the contents of the input object file.  All symbols and relocation
information will be discarded.  The memory dump will start at the
virtual address of the lowest section copied into the output file.
.PP
When generating an S-record or a raw binary file, it may be helpful to
use
.B -S
to remove sections containing debugging information.  In some cases
.B -R
will be useful to remove sections which contain information which is
not needed by the binary file.
.PP
.I infile
and
.I outfile
are the source and output files respectively.  If you do not specify
.IR outfile ,
.B objcopy
creates a temporary file and destructively renames the result with the
name of the input file.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-I \fIbfdname\fR, \fB\-\-input\-target=\fIbfdname
Consider the source file's object format to be 
.IR bfdname ,
rather than attempting to deduce it.
.TP
.B \-O \fIbfdname\fR, \fB\-\-output\-target=\fIbfdname
Write the output file using the object format 
.IR bfdname .
.TP
.B \-F \fIbfdname\fR, \fB\-\-target=\fIbfdname
Use 
.I bfdname
as the object format for both the input and the output file; i.e.
simply transfer data from source to destination with no translation.
.TP
.B \-R \fIsectionname\fR, \fB\-\-remove-section=\fIsectionname
Remove the named section from the file.  This option may be given more
than once.  Note that using this option inappropriately may make the
output file unusable.
.TP
.B \-S\fR, \fB\-\-strip\-all
Do not copy relocation and symbol information from the source file.
.TP
.B \-g\fR, \fB\-\-strip\-debug
Do not copy debugging symbols from the source file.
.TP
.B \-\-strip\-unneeded
Strip all symbols that are not needed for relocation processing.
.TP
.B \-K \fIsymbolname\fR, \fB\-\-keep\-symbol=\fIsymbolname
Copy only symbol \fIsymbolname\fP from the source file. This option
may be given more than once.
.TP
.B \-N \fIsymbolname\fR, \fB\-\-strip\-symbol=\fIsymbolname
Do not copy symbol \fIsymbolname\fP from the source file. This option
may be given more than once, and may be combined with strip options
other than \fB\-K\fR.
.TP
.B \-x\fR, \fB \-\-discard\-all
Do not copy non-global symbols from the source file.
.TP
.B \-X\fR, \fB\-\-discard\-locals
Do not copy compiler-generated local symbols. (These usually start
with "L" or ".").
.TP
.B \-b \fIbyte\fR, \fB\-\-byte=\fIbyte
Keep only every \fIbyte\fPth byte of the input file (header data is
not affected).  \fIbyte\fP can be in the range from 0 to the
interleave-1.  This option is useful for creating files to program
ROMs.  It is typically used with an srec output target.
.TP
.B \-i \fIinterleave\fR, \fB\-\-interleave=\fIinterleave
Only copy one out of every \fIinterleave\fP bytes.  Which one to copy is
selected by the \fB\-b\fP or \fB\-\-byte\fP option.  The default is 4.
The interleave is ignored if neither \fB\-b\fP nor \fB\-\-byte\fP is given.
.TP
.B \-\-debugging
Convert debugging information, if possible.  This is not the default
because only certain debugging formats are supported, and the
conversion process can be time consuming.
.TP
.B \-\-gap\-fill=\fIval
Fill gaps between sections with \fIval\fP.  This is done by increasing
the size of the section with the lower address, and filling in the extra
space created with \fIval\fP.
.TP
.B \-\-pad\-to=\fIaddress
Pad the output file up to the virtual address \fIaddress\fP.  This is
done by increasing the size of the last section.  The extra space is
filled in with the value specified by \fB\-\-gap\-fill\fP (default
zero).
.TP
.B \fB\-\-set\-start=\fIval
Set the start address of the new file to \fIval\fP.  Not all object
file formats support setting the start address.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-adjust\-start=\fIincr
Adjust the start address by adding \fIincr\fP.  Not all object file
formats support setting the start address.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-adjust\-vma=\fIincr
Adjust the address of all sections, as well as the start address, by
adding \fIincr\fP.  Some object file formats do not permit section
addresses to be changed arbitrarily.  Note that this does not relocate
the sections; if the program expects sections to be loaded at a
certain address, and this option is used to change the sections such
that they are loaded at a different address, the program may fail.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-adjust\-section\-vma=\fIsection{=,+,-}val
Set or adjust the address of the named \fIsection\fP.  If \fI=\fP is
used, the section address is set to \fIval\fP.  Otherwise, \fIval\fP
is added to or subtracted from the section address.  See the comments
under \fB\-\-adjust\-vma\fP, above.  If \fIsection\fP does not exist
in the input file, a warning will be issued, unless
\fB\-\-no\-adjust\-warnings\fP is used.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-adjust\-warnings
If \fB\-\-adjust\-section\-vma\fP is used, and the named section does
not exist, issue a warning.  This is the default.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-no\-adjust\-warnings
Do not issue a warning if \fB\-\-adjust\-section\-vma\fP is used, even
if the named section does not exist.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-set\-section\-flags=\fIsection=flags
Set the flags for the named section.  The \fIflags\fP argument is a
comma separated string of flag names.  The recognized names are
\fIalloc\fP, \fIload\fP, \fIreadonly\fP, \fIcode\fP, \fIdata\fP, and
\fIrom\fP.  Not all flags are meaningful for all object file
formats.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-add\-section=\fIsectionname=filename
Add a new section named \fIsectionname\fR while copying the file.  The
contents of the new section are taken from the file \fIfilename\fR.
The size of the section will be the size of the file.  This option
only works on file formats which can support sections with arbitrary
names.
.TP
.B \-\-remove\-leading\-char
If the first character of a global symbol is a special symbol leading
character used by the object file format, remove the character.  The
most common symbol leading character is underscore.  This option will
remove a leading underscore from all global symbols.  This can be useful
if you want to link together objects of different file formats with
different conventions for symbol names.
.TP
.B \-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose
Verbose output: list all object files modified.  In the case of
archives, "\fBobjcopy \-V\fR" lists all members of the archive.
.TP
.B \-V\fR, \fB\-\-version
Show the version number of
.B objcopy
and exit.
.TP
.B \-\-help
Show a summary of the options to
.B objcopy
and exit.
