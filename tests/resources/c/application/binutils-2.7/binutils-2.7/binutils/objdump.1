.SH DESCRIPTION
\c
.B objdump\c
\& displays information about one or more object files.
The options control what particular information to display.  This
information is mostly useful to programmers who are working on the
compilation tools, as opposed to programmers who just want their
program to compile and work.
.PP
.IR  "objfile" .\|.\|.
are the object files to be examined.  When you specify archives,
\c
.B objdump\c
\& shows information on each of the member object files.

.SH OPTIONS
Where long and short forms of an option are shown together, they are
equivalent.  At least one option besides
.B \-l
(\fB\-\-line\-numbers\fP) must be given.

.TP
.B \-a
.TP
.B \-\-archive\-headers
If any files from \c
.I objfile\c
\& are archives, display the archive
header information (in a format similar to `\|\c
.B ls \-l\c
\|').  Besides the
information you could list with `\|\c
.B ar tv\c
\|', `\|\c
.B objdump \-a\c
\|' shows
the object file format of each archive member.

.TP
.BI "\-b " "bfdname"\c
.TP
.BI "\-\-target=" "bfdname"
Specify the object-code format for the object files to be
\c
.I bfdname\c
\&.  This may not be necessary; \c
.I objdump\c
\& can
automatically recognize many formats.  For example,
.sp
.br
objdump\ \-b\ oasys\ \-m\ vax\ \-h\ fu.o
.br
.sp
display summary information from the section headers (`\|\c
.B \-h\c
\|') of
`\|\c
.B fu.o\c
\|', which is explicitly identified (`\|\c
.B \-m\c
\|') as a Vax object
file in the format produced by Oasys compilers.  You can list the
formats available with the `\|\c
.B \-i\c
\|' option.

.TP
.B \-\-debugging
Display debugging information.  This attempts to parse debugging
information stored in the file and print it out using a C like syntax.
Only certain types of debugging information have been implemented.

.TP
.B \-d
.TP
.B \-\-disassemble
Display the assembler mnemonics for the machine
instructions from \c
.I objfile\c
\&.
This option only disassembles those sections which are
expected to contain instructions.

.TP
.B \-D
.TP
.B \-\-disassemble-all
Like \fB\-d\fP, but disassemble the contents of all sections, not just
those expected to contain instructions.

.TP
.B \-EB
.TP
.B \-EL
.TP
.BI "\-\-endian=" "{big|little}"
Specify the endianness of the object files.  This only affects
disassembly.  This can be useful when disassembling a file format which
does not describe endianness information, such as S-records.

.TP
.B \-f
.TP
.B \-\-file\-headers
Display summary information from the overall header of
each file in \c
.I objfile\c
\&.

.TP
.B \-h
.TP
.B \-\-section\-headers
.TP
.B \-\-headers
Display summary information from the section headers of the
object file.

.TP
.B \-\-help
Print a summary of the options to
.B objdump
and exit.

.TP
.B \-i
.TP
.B \-\-info
Display a list showing all architectures and object formats available
for specification with \c
.B \-b\c
\& or \c
.B \-m\c
\&.

.TP
.BI "\-j " "name"\c
.TP
.BI "\-\-section=" "name"
Display information only for section \c
.I name\c
\&.

.TP
.B \-l
.TP
.B \-\-line\-numbers
Label the display (using debugging information) with the filename
and source line numbers corresponding to the object code shown.
Only useful with \fB\-d\fP, \fB\-D\fP, or \fB\-r\fP.

.TP
.BI "\-m " "machine"\c
.TP
.BI "\-\-architecture=" "machine"
Specify the architecture to use when disassembling object files.  This
can be useful when disasembling object files which do not describe
architecture information, such as S-records.  You can list the available
architectures with the \fB\-i\fP option. 

.TP
.B \-r
.TP
.B \-\-reloc
Print the relocation entries of the file.  If used with \fB\-d\fP or
\fB\-d\fP, the relocations are printed interspersed with the
disassembly.

.TP
.B \-R
.TP
.B \-\-dynamic\-reloc
Print the dynamic relocation entries of the file.  This is only
meaningful for dynamic objects, such as certain types of shared
libraries.

.TP
.B \-s
.TP
.B \-\-full\-contents
Display the full contents of any sections requested.

.TP
.B \-S
.TP
.B \-\-source
Display source code intermixed with disassembly, if possible.  Implies
\fB-d\fP.

.TP
.B \-\-show-raw-insn
When disassembling instructions, print the instruction in hex as well as
in symbolic form.  Not all targets handle this correctly yet.

.TP
.B \-\-stabs
Display the contents of the .stab, .stab.index, and .stab.excl
sections from an ELF file.  This is only useful on systems (such as
Solaris 2.0) in which .stab debugging symbol-table entries are carried
in an ELF section.  In most other file formats, debugging symbol-table
entries are interleaved with linkage symbols, and are visible in the
\-\-syms output.

.TP
.BI "\-\-start\-address=" "address"
Start displaying data at the specified address.  This affects the output
of the
.B \-d\c
,
.B \-r
and
.B \-s
options.

.TP
.BI "\-\-stop\-address=" "address"
Stop displaying data at the specified address.  This affects the output
of the
.B \-d\c
,
.B \-r
and
.B \-s
options.

.TP
.B \-t
.TP
.B \-\-syms
Symbol Table.  Print the symbol table entries of the file.
This is similar to the information provided by the `\|\c
.B nm\c
\|' program.

.TP
.B \-T
.TP
.B \-\-dynamic\-syms
Dynamic Symbol Table.  Print the dynamic symbol table entries of the
file.  This is only meaningful for dynamic objects, such as certain
types of shared libraries.  This is similar to the information
provided by the `\|\c
.B nm\c
\|' program when given the
.B \-D (\-\-dynamic)
option.

.TP
.B \-\-version
Print the version number of
.B objdump
and exit.

.TP
.B \-x
.TP
.B \-\-all\-headers
Display all available header information, including the symbol table and
relocation entries.  Using `\|\c
.B \-x\c
\|' is equivalent to specifying all of
`\|\c
.B \-a \-f \-h \-r \-t\c
\|'.
