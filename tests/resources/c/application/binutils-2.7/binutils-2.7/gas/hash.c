/*
 * BUGS, GRIPES, APOLOGIA etc.
 *
 * A typical user doesn't need ALL this: I intend to make a library out
 * of it one day - Dean Elsner.
 * Also, I want to change the definition of a symbol to (address,length)
 * so I can put arbitrary binary in the names stored. [see hsh.c for that]
 *
 * This slime is common coupled inside the module. Com-coupling (and other
 * vandalism) was done to speed running time. The interfaces at the
 * module's edges are adequately clean.
 *
 * There is no way to (a) run a test script through this heap and (b)
 * compare results with previous scripts, to see if we have broken any
 * code. Use GNU (f)utilities to do this. A few commands assist test.
 * The testing is awkward: it tries to be both batch & interactive.
 * For now, interactive rules!
 */

/*
 *  The idea is to implement a symbol table. A test jig is here.
 *  Symbols are arbitrary strings; they can't contain '\0'.
 *	[See hsh.c for a more general symbol flavour.]
 *  Each symbol is associated with a char*, which can point to anything
 *  you want, allowing an arbitrary property list for each symbol.
 *
 *  The basic operations are:
 *
 *    new                     creates symbol table, returns handle
 *    find (symbol)           returns char*
 *    insert (symbol,char*)   error if symbol already in table
 *    delete (symbol)         returns char* if symbol was in table
 *    apply                   so you can delete all symbols before die()
 *    die                     destroy symbol table (free up memory)
 *
 *  Supplementary functions include:
 *
 *    say                     how big? what % full?
 *    replace (symbol,newval) report previous value
 *    jam (symbol,value)      assert symbol:=value
 *
 *  You, the caller, have control over errors: this just reports them.
 *
 *  This package requires malloc(), free().
 *  Malloc(size) returns NULL or address of char[size].
 *  Free(address) frees same.
 */

/*
 *  The code and its structures are re-enterent.
 *
 *  Before you do anything else, you must call hash_new() which will
 *  return the address of a hash-table-control-block.  You then use
 *  this address as a handle of the symbol table by passing it to all
 *  the other hash_...() functions.  The only approved way to recover
 *  the memory used by the symbol table is to call hash_die() with the
 *  handle of the symbol table.
 *
 *  Before you call hash_die() you normally delete anything pointed to
 *  by individual symbols. After hash_die() you can't use that symbol
 *  table again.
 *
 *  The char* you associate with a symbol may not be NULL (0) because
 *  NULL is returned whenever a symbol is not in the table. Any other
 *  value is OK, except DELETED, #defined below.
 *
 *  When you supply a symbol string for insertion, YOU MUST PRESERVE THE
 *  STRING until that symbol is deleted from the table. The reason is that
 *  only the address you supply, NOT the symbol string itself, is stored
 *  in the symbol table.
 *
 *  You may delete and add symbols arbitrarily.
 *  Any or all symbols may have the same 'value' (char *). In fact, these
 *  routines don't do anything with your symbol values.
 *
 *  You have no right to know where the symbol:char* mapping is stored,
 *  because it moves around in memory; also because we may change how it
 *  works and we don't want to break your code do we? However the handle
 *  (address of struct hash_control) is never changed in
 *  the life of the symbol table.
 *
 *  What you CAN find out about a symbol table is:
 *    how many slots are in the hash table?
 *    how many slots are filled with symbols?
 *    (total hashes,collisions) for (reads,writes) (*)
 *  All of the above values vary in time.
 *  (*) some of these numbers will not be meaningful if we change the
 *  internals. */

/*
 *  I N T E R N A L
 *
 *  Hash table is an array of hash_entries; each entry is a pointer to a
 *  a string and a user-supplied value 1 char* wide.
 *
 *  The array always has 2 ** n elements, n>0, n integer.
 *  There is also a 'wall' entry after the array, which is always empty
 *  and acts as a sentinel to stop running off the end of the array.
 *  When the array gets too full, we create a new array twice as large
 *  and re-hash the symbols into the new array, then forget the old array.
 *  (Of course, we copy the values into the new array before we junk the
 *  old array!)
