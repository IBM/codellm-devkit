AT&T Syntax versus Intel Syntax
-------------------------------

   In order to maintain compatibility with the output of `gcc', `as'
supports AT&T System V/386 assembler syntax.  This is quite different
from Intel syntax.  We mention these differences because almost all
80386 documents used only Intel syntax.  Notable differences between
the two syntaxes are:

   * AT&T immediate operands are preceded by `$'; Intel immediate
     operands are undelimited (Intel `push 4' is AT&T `pushl $4').
     AT&T register operands are preceded by `%'; Intel register operands
     are undelimited.  AT&T absolute (as opposed to PC relative)
     jump/call operands are prefixed by `*'; they are undelimited in
     Intel syntax.

   * AT&T and Intel syntax use the opposite order for source and
     destination operands.  Intel `add eax, 4' is `addl $4, %eax'.  The
     `source, dest' convention is maintained for compatibility with
     previous Unix assemblers.

   * In AT&T syntax the size of memory operands is determined from the
     last character of the opcode name.  Opcode suffixes of `b', `w',
     and `l' specify byte (8-bit), word (16-bit), and long (32-bit)
     memory references.  Intel syntax accomplishes this by prefixes
     memory operands (*not* the opcodes themselves) with `byte ptr',
     `word ptr', and `dword ptr'.  Thus, Intel `mov al, byte ptr FOO'
     is `movb FOO, %al' in AT&T syntax.

   * Immediate form long jumps and calls are `lcall/ljmp $SECTION,
     $OFFSET' in AT&T syntax; the Intel syntax is `call/jmp far
     SECTION:OFFSET'.  Also, the far return instruction is `lret
     $STACK-ADJUST' in AT&T syntax; Intel syntax is `ret far
     STACK-ADJUST'.

   * The AT&T assembler does not provide support for multiple section
     programs.  Unix style systems expect all programs to be single
     sections.

Opcode Naming
-------------

   Opcode names are suffixed with one character modifiers which specify
the size of operands.  The letters `b', `w', and `l' specify byte,
word, and long operands.  If no suffix is specified by an instruction
and it contains no memory operands then `as' tries to fill in the
missing suffix based on the destination register operand (the last one
by convention).  Thus, `mov %ax, %bx' is equivalent to `movw %ax, %bx';
also, `mov $1, %bx' is equivalent to `movw $1, %bx'.  Note that this is
incompatible with the AT&T Unix assembler which assumes that a missing
opcode suffix implies long operand size.  (This incompatibility does
not affect compiler output since compilers always explicitly specify
the opcode suffix.)

   Almost all opcodes have the same names in AT&T and Intel format.
There are a few exceptions.  The sign extend and zero extend
instructions need two sizes to specify them.  They need a size to
sign/zero extend *from* and a size to zero extend *to*.  This is
accomplished by using two opcode suffixes in AT&T syntax.  Base names
for sign extend and zero extend are `movs...' and `movz...' in AT&T
syntax (`movsx' and `movzx' in Intel syntax).  The opcode suffixes are
tacked on to this base name, the *from* suffix before the *to* suffix.
Thus, `movsbl %al, %edx' is AT&T syntax for "move sign extend *from*
%al *to* %edx."  Possible suffixes, thus, are `bl' (from byte to long),
`bw' (from byte to word), and `wl' (from word to long).

   The Intel-syntax conversion instructions

   * `cbw' -- sign-extend byte in `%al' to word in `%ax',

   * `cwde' -- sign-extend word in `%ax' to long in `%eax',

   * `cwd' -- sign-extend word in `%ax' to long in `%dx:%ax',

   * `cdq' -- sign-extend dword in `%eax' to quad in `%edx:%eax',

are called `cbtw', `cwtl', `cwtd', and `cltd' in AT&T naming.  `as'
accepts either naming for these instructions.

   Far call/jump instructions are `lcall' and `ljmp' in AT&T syntax,
but are `call far' and `jump far' in Intel convention.

Register Naming
---------------

   Register operands are always prefixes with `%'.  The 80386 registers
consist of

   * the 8 32-bit registers `%eax' (the accumulator), `%ebx', `%ecx',
     `%edx', `%edi', `%esi', `%ebp' (the frame pointer), and `%esp'
     (the stack pointer).

   * the 8 16-bit low-ends of these: `%ax', `%bx', `%cx', `%dx', `%di',
     `%si', `%bp', and `%sp'.

   * the 8 8-bit registers: `%ah', `%al', `%bh', `%bl', `%ch', `%cl',
     `%dh', and `%dl' (These are the high-bytes and low-bytes of `%ax',
     `%bx', `%cx', and `%dx')

   * the 6 section registers `%cs' (code section), `%ds' (data
     section), `%ss' (stack section), `%es', `%fs', and `%gs'.

   * the 3 processor control registers `%cr0', `%cr2', and `%cr3'.

   * the 6 debug registers `%db0', `%db1', `%db2', `%db3', `%db6', and
     `%db7'.

   * the 2 test registers `%tr6' and `%tr7'.

   * the 8 floating point register stack `%st' or equivalently
     `%st(0)', `%st(1)', `%st(2)', `%st(3)', `%st(4)', `%st(5)',
     `%st(6)', and `%st(7)'.

Opcode Prefixes
---------------

   Opcode prefixes are used to modify the following opcode.  They are
used to repeat string instructions, to provide section overrides, to
perform bus lock operations, and to give operand and address size
(16-bit operands are specified in an instruction by prefixing what would
normally be 32-bit operands with a "operand size" opcode prefix).
Opcode prefixes are usually given as single-line instructions with no
operands, and must directly precede the instruction they act upon.  For
example, the `scas' (scan string) instruction is repeated with:
             repne
             scas

   Here is a list of opcode prefixes:

   * Section override prefixes `cs', `ds', `ss', `es', `fs', `gs'.
     These are automatically added by specifying using the
     SECTION:MEMORY-OPERAND form for memory references.

   * Operand/Address size prefixes `data16' and `addr16' change 32-bit
     operands/addresses into 16-bit operands/addresses.  Note that
     16-bit addressing modes (i.e. 8086 and 80286 addressing modes) are
     not supported (yet).

   * The bus lock prefix `lock' inhibits interrupts during execution of
     the instruction it precedes.  (This is only valid with certain
     instructions; see a 80386 manual for details).

   * The wait for coprocessor prefix `wait' waits for the coprocessor
     to complete the current instruction.  This should never be needed
     for the 80386/80387 combination.

   * The `rep', `repe', and `repne' prefixes are added to string
     instructions to make them repeat `%ecx' times.

Memory References
-----------------

   An Intel syntax indirect memory reference of the form

     SECTION:[BASE + INDEX*SCALE + DISP]

is translated into the AT&T syntax

     SECTION:DISP(BASE, INDEX, SCALE)

where BASE and INDEX are the optional 32-bit base and index registers,
DISP is the optional displacement, and SCALE, taking the values 1, 2,
4, and 8, multiplies INDEX to calculate the address of the operand.  If
no SCALE is specified, SCALE is taken to be 1.  SECTION specifies the
optional section register for the memory operand, and may override the
default section register (see a 80386 manual for section register
defaults). Note that section overrides in AT&T syntax *must* have be
preceded by a `%'.  If you specify a section override which coincides
with the default section register, `as' does *not* output any section
register override prefixes to assemble the given instruction.  Thus,
section overrides can be specified to emphasize which section register
is used for a given memory operand.

   Here are some examples of Intel and AT&T style memory references:

AT&T: `-4(%ebp)', Intel:  `[ebp - 4]'
     BASE is `%ebp'; DISP is `-4'. SECTION is missing, and the default
     section is used (`%ss' for addressing with `%ebp' as the base
     register).  INDEX, SCALE are both missing.

AT&T: `foo(,%eax,4)', Intel: `[foo + eax*4]'
     INDEX is `%eax' (scaled by a SCALE 4); DISP is `foo'.  All other
     fields are missing.  The section register here defaults to `%ds'.

AT&T: `foo(,1)'; Intel `[foo]'
     This uses the value pointed to by `foo' as a memory operand.  Note
     that BASE and INDEX are both missing, but there is only *one* `,'.
     This is a syntactic exception.

AT&T: `%gs:foo'; Intel `gs:foo'
     This selects the contents of the variable `foo' with section
     register SECTION being `%gs'.

   Absolute (as opposed to PC relative) call and jump operands must be
prefixed with `*'.  If no `*' is specified, `as' always chooses PC
relative addressing for jump/call labels.

   Any instruction that has a memory operand *must* specify its size
(byte, word, or long) with an opcode suffix (`b', `w', or `l',
respectively).

Handling of Jump Instructions
-----------------------------

   Jump instructions are always optimized to use the smallest possible
displacements.  This is accomplished by using byte (8-bit) displacement
jumps whenever the target is sufficiently close.  If a byte displacement
is insufficient a long (32-bit) displacement is used.  We do not support
word (16-bit) displacement jumps (i.e. prefixing the jump instruction
with the `addr16' opcode prefix), since the 80386 insists upon masking
`%eip' to 16 bits after the word displacement is added.

   Note that the `jcxz', `jecxz', `loop', `loopz', `loope', `loopnz'
and `loopne' instructions only come in byte displacements, so that if
you use these instructions (`gcc' does not use them) you may get an
error message (and incorrect code).  The AT&T 80386 assembler tries to
get around this problem by expanding `jcxz foo' to

              jcxz cx_zero
              jmp cx_nonzero
     cx_zero: jmp foo
     cx_nonzero:

Floating Point
--------------

   All 80387 floating point types except packed BCD are supported.
(BCD support may be added without much difficulty).  These data types
are 16-, 32-, and 64- bit integers, and single (32-bit), double
(64-bit), and extended (80-bit) precision floating point.  Each
supported type has an opcode suffix and a constructor associated with
it.  Opcode suffixes specify operand's data types.  Constructors build
these data types into memory.

   * Floating point constructors are `.float' or `.single', `.double',
     and `.tfloat' for 32-, 64-, and 80-bit formats.  These correspond
     to opcode suffixes `s', `l', and `t'.  `t' stands for temporary
     real, and that the 80387 only supports this format via the `fldt'
     (load temporary real to stack top) and `fstpt' (store temporary
     real and pop stack) instructions.

   * Integer constructors are `.word', `.long' or `.int', and `.quad'
     for the 16-, 32-, and 64-bit integer formats.  The corresponding
     opcode suffixes are `s' (single), `l' (long), and `q' (quad).  As
     with the temporary real format the 64-bit `q' format is only
     present in the `fildq' (load quad integer to stack top) and
     `fistpq' (store quad integer and pop stack) instructions.

   Register to register operations do not require opcode suffixes, so
that `fst %st, %st(1)' is equivalent to `fstl %st, %st(1)'.

   Since the 80387 automatically synchronizes with the 80386 `fwait'
instructions are almost never needed (this is not the case for the
80286/80287 and 8086/8087 combinations).  Therefore, `as' suppresses
the `fwait' instruction whenever it is implicitly selected by one of
the `fn...' instructions.  For example, `fsave' and `fnsave' are
treated identically.  In general, all the `fn...' instructions are made
equivalent to `f...' instructions.  If `fwait' is desired it must be
explicitly coded.

Writing 16-bit Code
-------------------

   While GAS normally writes only "pure" 32-bit i386 code, it has
limited support for writing code to run in real mode or in 16-bit
protected mode code segments.  To do this, insert a `.code16' directive
before the assembly language instructions to be run in 16-bit mode.
You can switch GAS back to writing normal 32-bit code with the
`.code32' directive.

   GAS understands exactly the same assembly language syntax in 16-bit
mode as in 32-bit mode.  The function of any given instruction is
exactly the same regardless of mode, as long as the resulting object
code is executed in the mode for which GAS wrote it.  So, for example,
the `ret' mnemonic produces a 32-bit return instruction regardless of
whether it is to be run in 16-bit or 32-bit mode.  (If GAS is in 16-bit
mode, it will add an operand size prefix to the instruction to force it
to be a 32-bit return.)

   This means, for one thing, that you can use GNU CC to write code to
be run in real mode or 16-bit protected mode.  Just insert the statement
`asm(".code16");' at the beginning of your C source file, and while GNU
CC will still be generating 32-bit code, GAS will automatically add all
the necessary size prefixes to make that code run in 16-bit mode.  Of
course, since GNU CC only writes small-model code (it doesn't know how
to attach segment selectors to pointers like native x86 compilers do),
any 16-bit code you write with GNU CC will essentially be limited to a
64K address space.  Also, there will be a code size and performance
penalty due to all the extra address and operand size prefixes GAS has
to add to the instructions.

   Note that placing GAS in 16-bit mode does not mean that the resulting
code will necessarily run on a 16-bit pre-80386 processor.  To write
code that runs on such a processor, you would have to refrain from using
*any* 32-bit constructs which require GAS to output address or operand
size prefixes.  At the moment this would be rather difficult, because
GAS currently supports *only* 32-bit addressing modes: when writing
16-bit code, it *always* outputs address size prefixes for any
instruction that uses a non-register addressing mode.  So you can write
code that runs on 16-bit processors, but only if that code never
references memory.

Notes
-----

   There is some trickery concerning the `mul' and `imul' instructions
that deserves mention.  The 16-, 32-, and 64-bit expanding multiplies
(base opcode `0xf6'; extension 4 for `mul' and 5 for `imul') can be
output only in the one operand form.  Thus, `imul %ebx, %eax' does
*not* select the expanding multiply; the expanding multiply would
clobber the `%edx' register, and this would confuse `gcc' output.  Use
`imul %ebx' to get the 64-bit product in `%edx:%eax'.

   We have added a two operand form of `imul' when the first operand is
an immediate mode expression and the second operand is a register.
This is just a shorthand, so that, multiplying `%eax' by 69, for
example, can be done with `imul $69, %eax' rather than `imul $69, %eax,
%eax'.

i960 Command-line Options
-------------------------

`-ACA | -ACA_A | -ACB | -ACC | -AKA | -AKB | -AKC | -AMC'
     Select the 80960 architecture.  Instructions or features not
     supported by the selected architecture cause fatal errors.

     `-ACA' is equivalent to `-ACA_A'; `-AKC' is equivalent to `-AMC'.
     Synonyms are provided for compatibility with other tools.

     If you do not specify any of these options, `as' generates code
     for any instruction or feature that is supported by *some* version
     of the 960 (even if this means mixing architectures!).  In
     principle, `as' attempts to deduce the minimal sufficient
     processor type if none is specified; depending on the object code
     format, the processor type may be recorded in the object file.  If
     it is critical that the `as' output match a specific architecture,
     specify that architecture explicitly.

`-b'
     Add code to collect information about conditional branches taken,
     for later optimization using branch prediction bits.  (The
     conditional branch instructions have branch prediction bits in the
     CA, CB, and CC architectures.)  If BR represents a conditional
     branch instruction, the following represents the code generated by
     the assembler when `-b' is specified:

                  call    INCREMENT ROUTINE
                  .word   0       # pre-counter
          Label:  BR
                  call    INCREMENT ROUTINE
                  .word   0       # post-counter

     The counter following a branch records the number of times that
     branch was *not* taken; the differenc between the two counters is
     the number of times the branch *was* taken.

     A table of every such `Label' is also generated, so that the
     external postprocessor `gbr960' (supplied by Intel) can locate all
     the counters.  This table is always labelled `__BRANCH_TABLE__';
     this is a local symbol to permit collecting statistics for many
     separate object files.  The table is word aligned, and begins with
     a two-word header.  The first word, initialized to 0, is used in
     maintaining linked lists of branch tables.  The second word is a
     count of the number of entries in the table, which follow
     immediately: each is a word, pointing to one of the labels
     illustrated above.

           +------------+------------+------------+ ... +------------+
           |            |            |            |     |            |
           |  *NEXT     |  COUNT: N  | *BRLAB 1   |     | *BRLAB N   |
           |            |            |            |     |            |
           +------------+------------+------------+ ... +------------+
          
                         __BRANCH_TABLE__ layout

     The first word of the header is used to locate multiple branch
     tables, since each object file may contain one. Normally the links
     are maintained with a call to an initialization routine, placed at
     the beginning of each function in the file.  The GNU C compiler
     generates these calls automatically when you give it a `-b' option.
     For further details, see the documentation of `gbr960'.

`-no-relax'
     Normally, Compare-and-Branch instructions with targets that require
     displacements greater than 13 bits (or that have external targets)
     are replaced with the corresponding compare (or `chkbit') and
     branch instructions.  You can use the `-no-relax' option to
     specify that `as' should generate errors instead, if the target
     displacement is larger than 13 bits.

     This option does not affect the Compare-and-Jump instructions; the
     code emitted for them is *always* adjusted when necessary
     (depending on displacement size), regardless of whether you use
     `-no-relax'.

i960 Machine Directives
-----------------------

`.bss SYMBOL, LENGTH, ALIGN'
     Reserve LENGTH bytes in the bss section for a local SYMBOL,
     aligned to the power of two specified by ALIGN.  LENGTH and ALIGN
     must be positive absolute expressions.  This directive differs
     from `.lcomm' only in that it permits you to specify an alignment.
     *Note `.lcomm': Lcomm.

`.extended FLONUMS'
     `.extended' expects zero or more flonums, separated by commas; for
     each flonum, `.extended' emits an IEEE extended-format (80-bit)
     floating-point number.

`.leafproc CALL-LAB, BAL-LAB'
     You can use the `.leafproc' directive in conjunction with the
     optimized `callj' instruction to enable faster calls of leaf
     procedures.  If a procedure is known to call no other procedures,
     you may define an entry point that skips procedure prolog code
     (and that does not depend on system-supplied saved context), and
     declare it as the BAL-LAB using `.leafproc'.  If the procedure
     also has an entry point that goes through the normal prolog, you
     can specify that entry point as CALL-LAB.

     A `.leafproc' declaration is meant for use in conjunction with the
     optimized call instruction `callj'; the directive records the data
     needed later to choose between converting the `callj' into a `bal'
     or a `call'.

     CALL-LAB is optional; if only one argument is present, or if the
     two arguments are identical, the single argument is assumed to be
     the `bal' entry point.

`.sysproc NAME, INDEX'
     The `.sysproc' directive defines a name for a system procedure.
     After you define it using `.sysproc', you can use NAME to refer to
     the system procedure identified by INDEX when calling procedures
     with the optimized call instruction `callj'.

     Both arguments are required; INDEX must be between 0 and 31
     (inclusive).

`callj'

   You can write `callj' to have the assembler or the linker determine
the most appropriate form of subroutine call: `call', `bal', or
`calls'.  If the assembly source contains enough information--a
`.leafproc' or `.sysproc' directive defining the operand--then `as'
translates the `callj'; if not, it simply emits the `callj', leaving it
for the linker to resolve.

Compare-and-Branch
..................

   The 960 architectures provide combined Compare-and-Branch
instructions that permit you to store the branch target in the lower 13
bits of the instruction word itself.  However, if you specify a branch
target far enough away that its address won't fit in 13 bits, the
assembler can either issue an error, or convert your Compare-and-Branch
instruction into separate instructions to do the compare and the branch.

   Whether `as' gives an error or expands the instruction depends on
two choices you can make: whether you use the `-no-relax' option, and
whether you use a "Compare and Branch" instruction or a "Compare and
Jump" instruction.  The "Jump" instructions are *always* expanded if
necessary; the "Branch" instructions are expanded when necessary
*unless* you specify `-no-relax'--in which case `as' gives an error
instead.

   These are the Compare-and-Branch instructions, their "Jump" variants,
and the instruction pairs they may expand into:

          Branch      Jump       Expanded to

M680x0 Options
--------------

   The Motorola 680x0 version of `as' has a few machine dependent
options.

   You can use the `-l' option to shorten the size of references to
undefined symbols.  If you do not use the `-l' option, references to
undefined symbols are wide enough for a full `long' (32 bits).  (Since
`as' cannot know where these symbols end up, `as' can only allocate
space for the linker to fill in later.  Since `as' does not know how
far away these symbols are, it allocates as much space as it can.)  If
you use this option, the references are only one word wide (16 bits).
This may be useful if you want the object file to be as small as
possible, and you know that the relevant symbols are always less than
17 bits away.

   For some configurations, especially those where the compiler normally
does not prepend an underscore to the names of user variables, the
assembler requires a `%' before any use of a register name.  This is
intended to let the assembler distinguish between C variables and
functions named `a0' through `a7', and so on.  The `%' is always
accepted, but is not required for certain configurations, notably
`sun3'.  The `--register-prefix-optional' option may be used to permit
omitting the `%' even for configurations for which it is normally
required.  If this is done, it will generally be impossible to refer to
C variables and functions with the same names as register names.

   Normally the character `|' is treated as a comment character, which
means that it can not be used in expressions.  The `--bitwise-or'
option turns `|' into a normal character.  In this mode, you must
either use C style comments, or start comments with a `#' character at
the beginning of a line.

   `as' can assemble code for several different members of the Motorola
680x0 family.  The default depends upon how `as' was configured when it
was built; normally, the default is to assemble code for the 68020
microprocessor.  The following options may be used to change the
default.  These options control which instructions and addressing modes
are permitted.  The members of the 680x0 family are very similar.  For
detailed information about the differences, see the Motorola manuals.

`-m68000'
`-m68008'
`-m68302'
     Assemble for the 68000.  `-m68008' and `-m68302' are synonyms for
     `-m68000', since the chips are the same from the point of view of
     the assembler.

`-m68010'
     Assemble for the 68010.

`-m68020'
     Assemble for the 68020.  This is normally the default.

`-m68030'
     Assemble for the 68030.

`-m68040'
     Assemble for the 68040.

`-m68060'
     Assemble for the 68060.

`-mcpu32'
`-m68331'
`-m68332'
`-m68333'
`-m68340'
`-m68360'
     Assemble for the CPU32 family of chips.

`-m68881'
`-m68882'
     Assemble 68881 floating point instructions.  This is the default
     for the 68020, 68030, and the CPU32.  The 68040 and 68060 always
     support floating point instructions.

`-mno-68881'
     Do not assemble 68881 floating point instructions.  This is the
     default for 68000 and the 68010.  The 68040 and 68060 always
     support floating point instructions, even if this option is used.

`-m68851'
     Assemble 68851 MMU instructions.  This is the default for the
     68020, 68030, and 68060.  The 68040 accepts a somewhat different
     set of MMU instructions; `-m68851' and `-m68040' should not be used
     together.

`-mno-68851'
     Do not assemble 68851 MMU instructions.  This is the default for
     the 68000, 68010, and the CPU32.  The 68040 accepts a somewhat
     different set of MMU instructions.

Syntax
------

   This syntax for the Motorola 680x0 was developed at MIT.

   The 680x0 version of `as' uses instructions names and syntax
compatible with the Sun assembler.  Intervening periods are ignored;
for example, `movl' is equivalent to `mov.l'.

   In the following table APC stands for any of the address registers
(`%a0' through `%a7'), the program counter (`%pc'), the zero-address
relative to the program counter (`%zpc'), a suppressed address register
(`%za0' through `%za7'), or it may be omitted entirely.  The use of
SIZE means one of `w' or `l', and it may be omitted, along with the
leading colon, unless a scale is also specified.  The use of SCALE
means one of `1', `2', `4', or `8', and it may always be omitted along
with the leading colon.

   The following addressing modes are understood:
"Immediate"
     `#NUMBER'

"Data Register"
     `%d0' through `%d7'

"Address Register"
     `%a0' through `%a7'
     `%a7' is also known as `%sp', i.e. the Stack Pointer.  `%a6' is
     also known as `%fp', the Frame Pointer.

"Address Register Indirect"
     `%a0@' through `%a7@'

"Address Register Postincrement"
     `%a0@+' through `%a7@+'

"Address Register Predecrement"
     `%a0@-' through `%a7@-'

"Indirect Plus Offset"
     `APC@(NUMBER)'

"Index"
     `APC@(NUMBER,REGISTER:SIZE:SCALE)'

     The NUMBER may be omitted.

"Postindex"
     `APC@(NUMBER)@(ONUMBER,REGISTER:SIZE:SCALE)'

     The ONUMBER or the REGISTER, but not both, may be omitted.

"Preindex"
     `APC@(NUMBER,REGISTER:SIZE:SCALE)@(ONUMBER)'

     The NUMBER may be omitted.  Omitting the REGISTER produces the
     Postindex addressing mode.

"Absolute"
     `SYMBOL', or `DIGITS', optionally followed by `:b', `:w', or `:l'.

Motorola Syntax
---------------

   The standard Motorola syntax for this chip differs from the syntax
already discussed (*note Syntax: M68K-Syntax.).  `as' can accept
Motorola syntax for operands, even if MIT syntax is used for other
operands in the same instruction.  The two kinds of syntax are fully
compatible.

   In the following table APC stands for any of the address registers
(`%a0' through `%a7'), the program counter (`%pc'), the zero-address
relative to the program counter (`%zpc'), or a suppressed address
register (`%za0' through `%za7').  The use of SIZE means one of `w' or
`l', and it may always be omitted along with the leading dot.  The use
of SCALE means one of `1', `2', `4', or `8', and it may always be
omitted along with the leading asterisk.

   The following additional addressing modes are understood:

"Address Register Indirect"
     `(%a0)' through `(%a7)'
     `%a7' is also known as `%sp', i.e. the Stack Pointer.  `%a6' is
     also known as `%fp', the Frame Pointer.

"Address Register Postincrement"
     `(%a0)+' through `(%a7)+'

"Address Register Predecrement"
     `-(%a0)' through `-(%a7)'

"Indirect Plus Offset"
     `NUMBER(%A0)' through `NUMBER(%A7)', or `NUMBER(%PC)'.

     The NUMBER may also appear within the parentheses, as in
     `(NUMBER,%A0)'.  When used with the PC, the NUMBER may be omitted
     (with an address register, omitting the NUMBER produces Address
     Register Indirect mode).

"Index"
     `NUMBER(APC,REGISTER.SIZE*SCALE)'

     The NUMBER may be omitted, or it may appear within the
     parentheses.  The APC may be omitted.  The REGISTER and the APC
     may appear in either order.  If both APC and REGISTER are address
     registers, and the SIZE and SCALE are omitted, then the first
     register is taken as the base register, and the second as the
     index register.

"Postindex"
     `([NUMBER,APC],REGISTER.SIZE*SCALE,ONUMBER)'

     The ONUMBER, or the REGISTER, or both, may be omitted.  Either the
     NUMBER or the APC may be omitted, but not both.

"Preindex"
     `([NUMBER,APC,REGISTER.SIZE*SCALE],ONUMBER)'

     The NUMBER, or the APC, or the REGISTER, or any two of them, may
     be omitted.  The ONUMBER may be omitted.  The REGISTER and the APC
     may appear in either order.  If both APC and REGISTER are address
     registers, and the SIZE and SCALE are omitted, then the first
     register is taken as the base register, and the second as the
     index register.

Floating Point
--------------

   Packed decimal (P) format floating literals are not supported.  Feel
free to add the code!

   The floating point formats generated by directives are these.

`.float'
     `Single' precision floating point constants.

`.double'
     `Double' precision floating point constants.

`.extend'
`.ldouble'
     `Extended' precision (`long double') floating point constants.

680x0 Machine Directives
------------------------

   In order to be compatible with the Sun assembler the 680x0 assembler
understands the following directives.

`.data1'
     This directive is identical to a `.data 1' directive.

`.data2'
     This directive is identical to a `.data 2' directive.

`.even'
     This directive is a special case of the `.align' directive; it
     aligns the output to an even byte boundary.

`.skip'
     This directive is identical to a `.space' directive.

Branch Improvement
..................

   Certain pseudo opcodes are permitted for branch instructions.  They
expand to the shortest branch instruction that reach the target.
Generally these mnemonics are made by substituting `j' for `b' at the
start of a Motorola mnemonic.

   The following table summarizes the pseudo-operations.  A `*' flags
cases that are more fully described after the table:

               Displacement
               +-------------------------------------------------
               |                68020   68000/10
     Pseudo-Op |BYTE    WORD    LONG    LONG      non-PC relative
               +-------------------------------------------------
          jbsr |bsrs    bsr     bsrl    jsr       jsr
           jra |bras    bra     bral    jmp       jmp
     *     jXX |bXXs    bXX     bXXl    bNXs;jmpl bNXs;jmp
     *    dbXX |dbXX    dbXX        dbXX; bra; jmpl
     *    fjXX |fbXXw   fbXXw   fbXXl             fbNXw;jmp
     
     XX: condition
     NX: negative of condition XX

                    `*'--see full description below

`jbsr'
`jra'
     These are the simplest jump pseudo-operations; they always map to
     one particular machine instruction, depending on the displacement
     to the branch target.

`jXX'
     Here, `jXX' stands for an entire family of pseudo-operations,
     where XX is a conditional branch or condition-code test.  The full
     list of pseudo-ops in this family is:
           jhi   jls   jcc   jcs   jne   jeq   jvc
           jvs   jpl   jmi   jge   jlt   jgt   jle

     For the cases of non-PC relative displacements and long
     displacements on the 68000 or 68010, `as' issues a longer code
     fragment in terms of NX, the opposite condition to XX.  For
     example, for the non-PC relative case:
              jXX foo
     gives
               bNXs oof
               jmp foo
           oof:

`dbXX'
     The full family of pseudo-operations covered here is
           dbhi   dbls   dbcc   dbcs   dbne   dbeq   dbvc
           dbvs   dbpl   dbmi   dbge   dblt   dbgt   dble
           dbf    dbra   dbt

     Other than for word and byte displacements, when the source reads
     `dbXX foo', `as' emits
               dbXX oo1
               bra oo2
           oo1:jmpl foo
           oo2:

`fjXX'
     This family includes
           fjne   fjeq   fjge   fjlt   fjgt   fjle   fjf
           fjt    fjgl   fjgle  fjnge  fjngl  fjngle fjngt

           fjor   fjseq  fjsf   fjsne  fjst   fjueq  fjuge
           fjugt  fjule  fjult  fjun

     For branch targets that are not PC relative, `as' emits
               fbNX oof
               jmp foo
           oof:
     when it encounters `fjXX foo'.

   The immediate character is `#' for Sun compatibility.  The
line-comment character is `|' (unless the `--bitwise-or' option is
used).  If a `#' appears at the beginning of a line, it is treated as a

MIPS Dependent Features
=======================

   GNU `as' for MIPS architectures supports the MIPS R2000, R3000,
R4000 and R6000 processors.  For information about the MIPS instruction
set, see `MIPS RISC Architecture', by Kane and Heindrich
(Prentice-Hall).  For an overview of MIPS assembly conventions, see
"Appendix D: Assembly Language Programming" in the same work.

Assembler options
-----------------

   The MIPS configurations of GNU `as' support these special options:

`-G NUM'
     This option sets the largest size of an object that can be
     referenced implicitly with the `gp' register.  It is only accepted
     for targets that use ECOFF format.  The default value is 8.

`-EB'
`-EL'
     Any MIPS configuration of `as' can select big-endian or
     little-endian output at run time (unlike the other GNU development
     tools, which must be configured for one or the other).  Use `-EB'
     to select big-endian output, and `-EL' for little-endian.

`-mips1'
`-mips2'
`-mips3'
     Generate code for a particular MIPS Instruction Set Architecture
     level.  `-mips1' corresponds to the R2000 and R3000 processors,
     `-mips2' to the R6000 processor, and `-mips3' to the R4000
     processor.  You can also switch instruction sets during the
     assembly; see *Note Directives to override the ISA level: MIPS ISA.

`-m4650'
`-no-m4650'
     Generate code for the MIPS R4650 chip.  This tells the assembler
     to accept the `mad' and `madu' instruction, and to not schedule
     `nop' instructions around accesses to the `HI' and `LO' registers.
     `-no-m4650' turns off this option.

`-m4010'
`-no-m4010'
     Generate code for the LSI R4010 chip.  This tells the assembler to
     accept the R4010 specific instructions (`addciu', `ffc', etc.),
     and to not schedule `nop' instructions around accesses to the `HI'
     and `LO' registers.  `-no-m4010' turns off this option.

`-mcpu=CPU'
     Generate code for a particular MIPS cpu.  This has little effect
     on the assembler, but it is passed by `gcc'.

`-nocpp'
     This option is ignored.  It is accepted for command-line
     compatibility with other assemblers, which use it to turn off C
     style preprocessing.  With GNU `as', there is no need for
     `-nocpp', because the GNU assembler itself never runs the C
     preprocessor.

`--trap'
`--no-break'
     `as' automatically macro expands certain division and
     multiplication instructions to check for overflow and division by
     zero.  This option causes `as' to generate code to take a trap
     exception rather than a break exception when an error is detected.
     The trap instructions are only supported at Instruction Set
     Architecture level 2 and higher.

`--break'
`--no-trap'
     Generate code to take a break exception rather than a trap
     exception when an error is detected.  This is the default.


File: as.info,  Node: MIPS Object,  Next: MIPS Stabs,  Prev: MIPS Opts,  Up: MIPS-Dependent

MIPS ECOFF object code
----------------------

   Assembling for a MIPS ECOFF target supports some additional sections
besides the usual `.text', `.data' and `.bss'.  The additional sections
are `.rdata', used for read-only data, `.sdata', used for small data,
and `.sbss', used for small common objects.

   When assembling for ECOFF, the assembler uses the `$gp' (`$28')
register to form the address of a "small object".  Any object in the
`.sdata' or `.sbss' sections is considered "small" in this sense.  For
external objects, or for objects in the `.bss' section, you can use the
`gcc' `-G' option to control the size of objects addressed via `$gp';
the default value is 8, meaning that a reference to any object eight
bytes or smaller uses `$gp'.  Passing `-G 0' to `as' prevents it from
using the `$gp' register on the basis of object size (but the assembler
uses `$gp' for objects in `.sdata' or `sbss' in any case).  The size of
an object in the `.bss' section is set by the `.comm' or `.lcomm'
directive that defines it.  The size of an external object may be set
with the `.extern' directive.  For example, `.extern sym,4' declares
that the object at `sym' is 4 bytes in length, whie leaving `sym'
otherwise undefined.

   Using small ECOFF objects requires linker support, and assumes that
the `$gp' register is correctly initialized (normally done
automatically by the startup code).  MIPS ECOFF assembly code must not
modify the `$gp' register.


File: as.info,  Node: MIPS Stabs,  Next: MIPS ISA,  Prev: MIPS Object,  Up: MIPS-Dependent

Directives for debugging information
------------------------------------

   MIPS ECOFF `as' supports several directives used for generating
debugging information which are not support by traditional MIPS
assemblers.  These are `.def', `.endef', `.dim', `.file', `.scl',
`.size', `.tag', `.type', `.val', `.stabd', `.stabn', and `.stabs'.
The debugging information generated by the three `.stab' directives can
only be read by GDB, not by traditional MIPS debuggers (this
enhancement is required to fully support C++ debugging).  These
directives are primarily used by compilers, not assembly language
programmers!


File: as.info,  Node: MIPS ISA,  Prev: MIPS Stabs,  Up: MIPS-Dependent

Directives to override the ISA level
------------------------------------

   GNU `as' supports an additional directive to change the MIPS
Instruction Set Architecture level on the fly: `.set mipsN'.  N should
be a number from 0 to 3.  A value from 1 to 3 makes the assembler
accept instructions for the corresponding ISA level, from that point on
in the assembly.  `.set mipsN' affects not only which instructions are
permitted, but also how certain macros are expanded.  `.set mips0'
restores the ISA level to its original level: either the level you
selected with command line options, or the default for your
configuration.  You can use this feature to permit specific R4000
instructions while assembling in 32 bit mode.  Use this directive with
care!

   Traditional MIPS assemblers do not support this directive.

Special Characters
..................

   `!' is the line comment character.

   You can use `;' instead of a newline to separate statements.

   Since `$' has no special meaning, you may use it in symbol names.

Register Names
..............

   You can use the predefined symbols `r0', `r1', `r2', `r3', `r4',
`r5', `r6', `r7', `r8', `r9', `r10', `r11', `r12', `r13', `r14', and
`r15' to refer to the SH registers.

   The SH also has these control registers:

`pr'
     procedure register (holds return address)

`pc'
     program counter

`mach'
`macl'
     high and low multiply accumulator registers

`sr'
     status register

`gbr'
     global base register

`vbr'
     vector base register (for interrupt vectors)

Addressing Modes
................

   `as' understands the following addressing modes for the SH.  `RN' in
the following refers to any of the numbered registers, but *not* the
control registers.

`RN'
     Register direct

`@RN'
     Register indirect

`@-RN'
     Register indirect with pre-decrement

`@RN+'
     Register indirect with post-increment

`@(DISP, RN)'
     Register indirect with displacement

`@(R0, RN)'
     Register indexed

`@(DISP, GBR)'
     `GBR' offset

`@(R0, GBR)'
     GBR indexed

`ADDR'
`@(DISP, PC)'
     PC relative address (for branch or for addressing memory).  The
     `as' implementation allows you to use the simpler form ADDR
     anywhere a PC relative address is called for; the alternate form
     is supported for compatibility with other assemblers.

`#IMM'
     Immediate data

Floating Point
--------------

   The SH family has no hardware floating point, but the `.float'
directive generates IEEE floating-point numbers for compatibility with
other development tools.

SH Machine Directives
---------------------

   `as' has no machine-dependent directives for the SH.
