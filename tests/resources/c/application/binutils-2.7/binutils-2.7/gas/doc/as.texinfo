@c @smallbook
@c @set SMALL
@c WARE! Some of the machine-dependent sections contain tables of machine
@c instructions.  Except in multi-column format, these tables look silly.
@c Unfortunately, Texinfo doesn't have a general-purpose multi-col format, so
@c the multi-col format is faked within @example sections.
@c 
@c Again unfortunately, the natural size that fits on a page, for these tables,
@c is different depending on whether or not smallbook is turned on.
@c This matters, because of order: text flow switches columns at each page
@c break.
@c 
@c The format faked in this source works reasonably well for smallbook,
@c not well for the default large-page format.  This manual expects that if you
@c turn on @smallbook, you will also uncomment the "@set SMALL" to enable the
@c tables in question.  You can turn on one without the other at your
@c discretion, of course. 
@ifinfo

@c the insn tables look just as silly in info files regardless of smallbook,
@c might as well show 'em anyways.

@table @code
@item -a[dhlns]
Turn on listings, in any of a variety of ways:

@table @code
@item -ad
omit debugging directives

@item -ah
include high-level source

@item -al
include assembly

@item -an
omit forms processing

@item -as
include symbols

@item =file
set the name of the listing file
@end table

You may combine these options; for example, use @samp{-aln} for assembly
listing without forms processing.  The @samp{=file} option, if used, must be
the last one.  By itself, @samp{-a} defaults to @samp{-ahls}---that is, all
listings turned on.

@item -D
Ignored.  This option is accepted for script compatibility with calls to
other assemblers.

@item --defsym @var{sym}=@var{value}
Define the symbol @var{sym} to be @var{value} before assembling the input file.
@var{value} must be an integer constant.  As in C, a leading @samp{0x}
indicates a hexadecimal value, and a leading @samp{0} indicates an octal value.

@item -f
``fast''---skip whitespace and comment preprocessing (assume source is
compiler output).

@item --help
Print a summary of the command line options and exit.

@item -I @var{dir}
Add directory @var{dir} to the search list for @code{.include} directives.

@item -J
Don't warn about signed overflow.

@item -K
@ifclear DIFF-TBL-KLUGE
This option is accepted but has no effect on the @value{TARGET} family.
@end ifclear
@ifset DIFF-TBL-KLUGE
Issue warnings when difference tables altered for long displacements.
@end ifset

@item -L
Keep (in the symbol table) local symbols, starting with @samp{L}.

@item -o @var{objfile}
Name the object-file output from @code{@value{AS}} @var{objfile}.

@item -R
Fold the data section into the text section.

@item --statistics
Print the maximum space (in bytes) and total time (in seconds) used by
assembly.

@item -v
@itemx -version
Print the @code{as} version.

@item --version
Print the @code{as} version and exit.

@item -W
Suppress warning messages.

@item -w
Ignored.

@item -x
Ignored.

@item -Z
Generate an object file even after errors.

@item -- | @var{files} @dots{}
Standard input, or source files to assemble.

@end table

@ifset ARC
The following options are available when @value{AS} is configured for
an ARC processor.

@table @code

@cindex ARC endianness
@cindex endianness, ARC
@cindex big endian output, ARC
@item -mbig-endian
Generate ``big endian'' format output.

@cindex little endian output, ARC
@item -mlittle-endian
Generate ``little endian'' format output.

@end table
@end ifset

@ifset I960
The following options are available when @value{AS} is configured for the
Intel 80960 processor.

@table @code
@item -ACA | -ACA_A | -ACB | -ACC | -AKA | -AKB | -AKC | -AMC
Specify which variant of the 960 architecture is the target.

@item -b
Add code to collect statistics about branches taken.

@item -no-relax
Do not alter compare-and-branch instructions for long displacements;
error if necessary.

@end table
@end ifset

@ifset M680X0
The following options are available when @value{AS} is configured for the
Motorola 68000 series.

@table @code

@item -l
Shorten references to undefined symbols, to one word instead of two.

@item -m68000 | -m68008 | -m68010 | -m68020 | -m68030 | -m68040
@itemx | -m68302 | -m68331 | -m68332 | -m68333 | -m68340 | -mcpu32
Specify what processor in the 68000 family is the target.  The default
is normally the 68020, but this can be changed at configuration time.

@item -m68881 | -m68882 | -mno-68881 | -mno-68882
The target machine does (or does not) have a floating-point coprocessor.
The default is to assume a coprocessor for 68020, 68030, and cpu32.  Although
the basic 68000 is not compatible with the 68881, a combination of the
two can be specified, since it's possible to do emulation of the
coprocessor instructions with the main processor.

@item -m68851 | -mno-68851
The target machine does (or does not) have a memory-management
unit coprocessor.  The default is to assume an MMU for 68020 and up.

@end table
@end ifset

@ifset SPARC
The following options are available when @code{@value{AS}} is configured
for the SPARC architecture:

@table @code
@item -Av6 | -Av7 | -Av8 | -Asparclite | -Av9 | -Av9a
Explicitly select a variant of the SPARC architecture.

@item -xarch=v8plus | -xarch=v8plusa
For compatibility with the Solaris v9 assembler.  These options are
equivalent to -Av9 and -Av9a, respectively.

@item -bump
Warn when the assembler switches to another architecture.
@end table
@end ifset

@ifset MIPS
The following options are available when @value{AS} is configured for
a MIPS processor.

@table @code
@item -G @var{num}
This option sets the largest size of an object that can be referenced
implicitly with the @code{gp} register.  It is only accepted for targets that
use ECOFF format, such as a DECstation running Ultrix.  The default value is 8.

@cindex MIPS endianness
@cindex endianness, MIPS
@cindex big endian output, MIPS
@item -EB
Generate ``big endian'' format output.

@cindex little endian output, MIPS
@item -EL
Generate ``little endian'' format output.

@cindex MIPS ISA
@item -mips1
@itemx -mips2
@itemx -mips3
Generate code for a particular MIPS Instruction Set Architecture level.
@samp{-mips1} corresponds to the @sc{r2000} and @sc{r3000} processors,
@samp{-mips2} to the @sc{r6000} processor, and @samp{-mips3} to the @sc{r4000}
processor.

@item -m4650
@item -no-m4650
Generate code for the MIPS @sc{r4650} chip.  This tells the assembler to accept
the @samp{mad} and @samp{madu} instruction, and to not schedule @samp{nop}
instructions around accesses to the @samp{HI} and @samp{LO} registers.
@samp{-no-m4650} turns off this option.

@item -mcpu=@var{CPU}
Generate code for a particular MIPS cpu.  This has little effect on the
assembler, but it is passed by @code{@value{GCC}}.

@cindex emulation
@item --emulation=@var{name}
This option causes @code{@value{AS}} to emulated @code{@value{AS}} configured
for some other target, in all respects, including output format (choosing
between ELF and ECOFF only), handling of pseudo-opcodes which may generate
debugging information or store symbol table information, and default
endianness.  The available configuration names are: @samp{mipsecoff},
@samp{mipself}, @samp{mipslecoff}, @samp{mipsbecoff}, @samp{mipslelf},
@samp{mipsbelf}.  The first two do not alter the default endianness from that
of the primary target for which the assembler was configured; the others change
the default to little- or big-endian as indicated by the @samp{b} or @samp{l}
in the name.  Using @samp{-EB} or @samp{-EL} will override the endianness
selection in any case.

This option is currently supported only when the primary target
@code{@value{AS}} is configured for is a MIPS ELF or ECOFF target.
Furthermore, the primary target or others specified with
@samp{--enable-targets=@dots{}} at configuration time must include support for
the other format, if both are to be available.  For example, the Irix 5
configuration includes support for both.

Eventually, this option will support more configurations, with more
fine-grained control over the assembler's behavior, and will be supported for
more processors.

@item -nocpp
@code{@value{AS}} ignores this option.  It is accepted for compatibility with
the native tools.

@need 900
@item --trap
@itemx --no-trap
@itemx --break
@itemx --no-break
Control how to deal with multiplication overflow and division by zero.
@samp{--trap} or @samp{--no-break} (which are synonyms) take a trap exception
(and only work for Instruction Set Architecture level 2 and higher);
@samp{--break} or @samp{--no-trap} (also synonyms, and the default) take a
break exception.

@node Manual
@section Structure of this Manual

@cindex manual, structure and purpose
This manual is intended to describe what you need to know to use
@sc{gnu} @code{@value{AS}}.  We cover the syntax expected in source files, including
notation for symbols, constants, and expressions; the directives that
@code{@value{AS}} understands; and of course how to invoke @code{@value{AS}}.

@ifclear GENERIC
We also cover special features in the @value{TARGET}
configuration of @code{@value{AS}}, including assembler directives.
@end ifclear
@ifset GENERIC
This manual also describes some of the machine-dependent features of
various flavors of the assembler.
@end ifset

@cindex machine instructions (not covered)
On the other hand, this manual is @emph{not} intended as an introduction
to programming in assembly language---let alone programming in general!
In a similar vein, we make no attempt to introduce the machine
architecture; we do @emph{not} describe the instruction set, standard
mnemonics, registers or addressing modes that are standard to a
particular architecture.
@ifset GENERIC
You may want to consult the manufacturer's
machine architecture manual for this information.
@end ifset
@ifclear GENERIC
@ifset H8/300
For information on the H8/300 machine instruction set, see @cite{H8/300
Series Programming Manual} (Hitachi ADE--602--025).  For the H8/300H,
see @cite{H8/300H Series Programming Manual} (Hitachi).
@end ifset
@ifset H8/500
For information on the H8/500 machine instruction set, see @cite{H8/500

@end ifclear

@c I think this is premature---doc@cygnus.com, 17jan1991
@ignore
Throughout this manual, we assume that you are running @dfn{GNU},
the portable operating system from the @dfn{Free Software
Foundation, Inc.}.  This restricts our attention to certain kinds of
computer (in particular, the kinds of computers that @sc{gnu} can run on);
once this assumption is granted examples and definitions need less
qualification.

@code{@value{AS}} is part of a team of programs that turn a high-level
human-readable series of instructions into a low-level
computer-readable series of instructions.  Different versions of
@code{@value{AS}} are used for different kinds of computer.
@end ignore

@c There used to be a section "Terminology" here, which defined
@c "contents", "byte", "word", and "long".  Defining "word" to any
@c particular size is confusing when the .word directive may generate 16
@c bits on one machine and 32 bits on another; in general, for the user
@c version of this manual, none of these terms seem essential to define.
@c They were used very little even in the former draft of the manual;
@c this draft makes an effort to avoid them (except in names of
@c directives).

@node GNU Assembler
@section @value{AS}, the GNU Assembler

@sc{gnu} @code{as} is really a family of assemblers.
@ifclear GENERIC
This manual describes @code{@value{AS}}, a member of that family which is
configured for the @value{TARGET} architectures.
@end ifclear
If you use (or have used) the @sc{gnu} assembler on one architecture, you
should find a fairly similar environment when you use it on another
architecture.  Each version has much in common with the others,
including object file formats, most assembler directives (often called
@dfn{pseudo-ops}) and assembler syntax.@refill

@cindex purpose of @sc{gnu} @code{@value{AS}}
@code{@value{AS}} is primarily intended to assemble the output of the
@sc{gnu} C compiler @code{@value{GCC}} for use by the linker
@code{@value{LD}}.  Nevertheless, we've tried to make @code{@value{AS}}
assemble correctly everything that other assemblers for the same
machine would assemble.
@ifset VAX
Any exceptions are documented explicitly (@pxref{Machine Dependencies}).
@end ifset
@ifset M680X0
@c This remark should appear in generic version of manual; assumption
@c here is that generic version sets M680x0.
This doesn't mean @code{@value{AS}} always uses the same syntax as another
assembler for the same architecture; for example, we know of several
incompatible versions of 680x0 assembly language syntax.
@end ifset

Unlike older assemblers, @code{@value{AS}} is designed to assemble a source
program in one pass of the source file.  This has a subtle impact on the
@kbd{.org} directive (@pxref{Org,,@code{.org}}).

@node Object Formats
@section Object File Formats

@cindex object file format
The @sc{gnu} assembler can be configured to produce several alternative
object file formats.  For the most part, this does not affect how you
write assembly language programs; but directives for debugging symbols
are typically different in different file formats.  @xref{Symbol
Attributes,,Symbol Attributes}.
@ifclear GENERIC
@ifclear MULTI-OBJ
On the @value{TARGET}, @code{@value{AS}} is configured to produce
@value{OBJ-NAME} format object files.
@end ifclear
@c The following should exhaust all configs that set MULTI-OBJ, ideally
@ifset A29K
On the @value{TARGET}, @code{@value{AS}} can be configured to produce either
@code{a.out} or COFF format object files.
@end ifset
@ifset I960
On the @value{TARGET}, @code{@value{AS}} can be configured to produce either
@code{b.out} or COFF format object files.
@end ifset
@ifset HPPA
On the @value{TARGET}, @code{@value{AS}} can be configured to produce either
SOM or ELF format object files.
@end ifset
@end ifclear

@node Command Line
@section Command Line

@cindex command line conventions
After the program name @code{@value{AS}}, the command line may contain
options and file names.  Options may appear in any order, and may be
before, after, or between file names.  The order of file names is
significant.

@cindex standard input, as input file
@kindex --
@file{--} (two hyphens) by itself names the standard input file
explicitly, as one of the files for @code{@value{AS}} to assemble.

@cindex options, command line
Except for @samp{--} any command line argument that begins with a
hyphen (@samp{-}) is an option.  Each option changes the behavior of
@code{@value{AS}}.  No option changes the way another option works.  An
option is a @samp{-} followed by one or more letters; the case of
the letter is important.   All options are optional.

Some options expect exactly one file name to follow them.  The file
name may either immediately follow the option's letter (compatible
with older assemblers) or it may be the next command argument (@sc{gnu}
standard).  These two command lines are equivalent:

@smallexample
@value{AS} -o my-object-file.o mumble.s
@value{AS} -omy-object-file.o mumble.s
@end smallexample

@node Input Files
@section Input Files

@cindex input
@cindex source program
@cindex files, input
We use the phrase @dfn{source program}, abbreviated @dfn{source}, to
describe the program input to one run of @code{@value{AS}}.  The program may
be in one or more files; how the source is partitioned into files
doesn't change the meaning of the source.

@c I added "con" prefix to "catenation" just to prove I can overcome my
@c APL training...   doc@cygnus.com
The source program is a concatenation of the text in all the files, in the
order specified.

Each time you run @code{@value{AS}} it assembles exactly one source
program.  The source program is made up of one or more files.
(The standard input is also a file.)

You give @code{@value{AS}} a command line that has zero or more input file
names.  The input files are read (from left file name to right).  A
command line argument (in any position) that has no special meaning
is taken to be an input file name.

If you give @code{@value{AS}} no file names it attempts to read one input file
from the @code{@value{AS}} standard input, which is normally your terminal.  You
may have to type @key{ctl-D} to tell @code{@value{AS}} there is no more program
to assemble.

Use @samp{--} if you need to explicitly name the standard input file
in your command line.

If the source is empty, @code{@value{AS}} produces a small, empty object
file.

@subheading Filenames and Line-numbers

@cindex input file linenumbers
@cindex line numbers, in input files
There are two ways of locating a line in the input file (or files) and
either may be used in reporting error messages.  One way refers to a line
number in a physical file; the other refers to a line number in a
``logical'' file.  @xref{Errors, ,Error and Warning Messages}.

@dfn{Physical files} are those files named in the command line given
to @code{@value{AS}}.

@dfn{Logical files} are simply names declared explicitly by assembler
directives; they bear no relation to physical files.  Logical file names
help error messages reflect the original source file, when @code{@value{AS}}
source is itself synthesized from other files.
@xref{App-File,,@code{.app-file}}.

@node Object
@section Output (Object) File

@cindex object file
@cindex output file
@kindex a.out
@kindex .o
Every time you run @code{@value{AS}} it produces an output file, which is
your assembly language program translated into numbers.  This file
is the object file.  Its default name is
@ifclear BOUT
@code{a.out}.
@end ifclear
@ifset BOUT
@ifset GENERIC
@code{a.out}, or 
@end ifset
@code{b.out} when @code{@value{AS}} is configured for the Intel 80960.
@end ifset
You can give it another name by using the @code{-o} option.  Conventionally,
object file names end with @file{.o}.  The default name is used for historical
reasons: older assemblers were capable of assembling self-contained programs
directly into a runnable program.  (For some formats, this isn't currently
possible, but it can be done for the @code{a.out} format.)

@cindex linker
@kindex ld
The object file is meant for input to the linker @code{@value{LD}}.  It contains
assembled program code, information to help @code{@value{LD}} integrate
the assembled program into a runnable file, and (optionally) symbolic
information for the debugger.

@c link above to some info file(s) like the description of a.out.
@c don't forget to describe @sc{gnu} info as well as Unix lossage.

@node Errors
@section Error and Warning Messages

@cindex error messsages
@cindex warning messages
@cindex messages from @code{@value{AS}}
@code{@value{AS}} may write warnings and error messages to the standard error
file (usually your terminal).  This should not happen when  a compiler
runs @code{@value{AS}} automatically.  Warnings report an assumption made so
that @code{@value{AS}} could keep assembling a flawed program; errors report a
grave problem that stops the assembly.

@cindex format of warning messages
Warning messages have the format

@smallexample
file_name:@b{NNN}:Warning Message Text
@end smallexample

@noindent
@cindex line numbers, in warnings/errors
(where @b{NNN} is a line number).  If a logical file name has been given
(@pxref{App-File,,@code{.app-file}}) it is used for the filename,
otherwise the name of the current input file is used.  If a logical line
number was given
@ifset GENERIC
(@pxref{Line,,@code{.line}})
@end ifset
@ifclear GENERIC
@ifclear A29K
(@pxref{Line,,@code{.line}})
@end ifclear
@ifset A29K
(@pxref{Ln,,@code{.ln}})
@end ifset
@end ifclear
then it is used to calculate the number printed,
otherwise the actual line in the current source file is printed.  The
message text is intended to be self explanatory (in the grand Unix
tradition).

@cindex format of error messages
Error messages have the format
@smallexample
file_name:@b{NNN}:FATAL:Error Message Text
@end smallexample
The file name and line number are derived as for warning
messages.  The actual message text may be rather less explanatory
because many of them aren't supposed to happen.

@node Invoking
@chapter Command-Line Options

@cindex options, all versions of @code{@value{AS}}
This chapter describes command-line options available in @emph{all}
versions of the @sc{gnu} assembler; @pxref{Machine Dependencies}, for options specific
@ifclear GENERIC
to the @value{TARGET}.
@end ifclear
@ifset GENERIC
to particular machine architectures.
@end ifset

If you are invoking @code{@value{AS}} via the @sc{gnu} C compiler (version 2), you
can use the @samp{-Wa} option to pass arguments through to the
assembler.  The assembler arguments must be separated from each other
(and the @samp{-Wa}) by commas.  For example:

@smallexample
gcc -c -g -O -Wa,-alh,-L file.c
@end smallexample

@noindent
emits a listing to standard output with high-level
and assembly source.

Usually you do not need to use this @samp{-Wa} mechanism, since many compiler
command-line options are automatically passed to the assembler by the compiler.
(You can call the @sc{gnu} compiler driver with the @samp{-v} option to see
precisely what options it passes to each compilation pass, including the
assembler.)

@kindex -a
@kindex -ad
@kindex -ah
@kindex -al
@kindex -an
@kindex -as
@cindex listings, enabling
@cindex assembly listings, enabling

These options enable listing output from the assembler.  By itself,
@samp{-a} requests high-level, assembly, and symbols listing.
You can use other letters to select specific options for the list:
@samp{-ah} requests a high-level language listing,
@samp{-al} requests an output-program assembly listing, and
@samp{-as} requests a symbol table listing.
High-level listings require that a compiler debugging option like
@samp{-g} be used, and that assembly listings (@samp{-al}) be requested
also.

Use the @samp{-ad} option to omit debugging directives from the
listing.

Once you have specified one of these options, you can further control
listing output and its appearance using the directives @code{.list},
@code{.nolist}, @code{.psize}, @code{.eject}, @code{.title}, and
@code{.sbttl}.
The @samp{-an} option turns off all forms processing.
If you do not request listing output with one of the @samp{-a} options, the
listing-control directives have no effect.

The letters after @samp{-a} may be combined into one option,
@emph{e.g.}, @samp{-aln}.

@node D
@section @code{-D}

@kindex -D
This option has no effect whatsoever, but it is accepted to make it more
likely that scripts written for other assemblers also work with
@code{@value{AS}}.

@node f
@section Work Faster: @code{-f}

@kindex -f
@cindex trusted compiler
@cindex faster processing (@code{-f})
@samp{-f} should only be used when assembling programs written by a
(trusted) compiler.  @samp{-f} stops the assembler from doing whitespace
and comment preprocessing on
the input file(s) before assembling them.  @xref{Preprocessing,
,Preprocessing}.

@quotation
@emph{Warning:} if you use @samp{-f} when the files actually need to be
preprocessed (if they contain comments, for example), @code{@value{AS}} does
not work correctly.
@end quotation

@node I
@section @code{.include} search path: @code{-I} @var{path}

@kindex -I @var{path}
@cindex paths for @code{.include}
@cindex search path for @code{.include}
@cindex @code{include} directive search path
Use this option to add a @var{path} to the list of directories
@code{@value{AS}} searches for files specified in @code{.include}
directives (@pxref{Include,,@code{.include}}).  You may use @code{-I} as
many times as necessary to include a variety of paths.  The current
working directory is always searched first; after that, @code{@value{AS}}
searches any @samp{-I} directories in the same order as they were
specified (left to right) on the command line.

@node K
@section Difference Tables: @code{-K}

@kindex -K
@ifclear DIFF-TBL-KLUGE
On the @value{TARGET} family, this option is allowed, but has no effect.  It is
permitted for compatibility with the @sc{gnu} assembler on other platforms,
where it can be used to warn when the assembler alters the machine code
generated for @samp{.word} directives in difference tables.  The @value{TARGET}
family does not have the addressing limitations that sometimes lead to this
alteration on other platforms.
@end ifclear

@ifset DIFF-TBL-KLUGE
@cindex difference tables, warning
@cindex warning for altered difference tables
@code{@value{AS}} sometimes alters the code emitted for directives of the form
@samp{.word @var{sym1}-@var{sym2}}; @pxref{Word,,@code{.word}}.
You can use the @samp{-K} option if you want a warning issued when this
is done.
@end ifset

@node L
@section Include Local Labels: @code{-L}

@kindex -L
@cindex local labels, retaining in output
Labels beginning with @samp{L} (upper case only) are called @dfn{local
labels}. @xref{Symbol Names}.  Normally you do not see such labels when
debugging, because they are intended for the use of programs (like
compilers) that compose assembler programs, not for your notice.
Normally both @code{@value{AS}} and @code{@value{LD}} discard such labels, so you do not
normally debug with them.

This option tells @code{@value{AS}} to retain those @samp{L@dots{}} symbols
in the object file.  Usually if you do this you also tell the linker
@code{@value{LD}} to preserve symbols whose names begin with @samp{L}.

By default, a local label is any label beginning with @samp{L}, but each
target is allowed to redefine the local label prefix.
@ifset HPPA
On the HPPA local labels begin with @samp{L$}.
@end ifset

@node M
@section Assemble in MRI Compatibility Mode: @code{-M}

@kindex -M
@cindex MRI compatibility mode
The @code{-M} or @code{--mri} option selects MRI compatibility mode.  This
changes the syntax and pseudo-op handling of @code{@value{AS}} to make it
compatible with the @code{ASM68K} or the @code{ASM960} (depending upon the
configured target) assembler from Microtec Research.  The exact nature of the
MRI syntax will not be documented here; see the MRI manuals for more
information.  The purpose of this option is to permit assembling existing MRI
assembler code using @code{@value{AS}}.

The MRI compatibility is not complete.  Certain operations of the MRI assembler
depend upon its object file format, and can not be supported using other object
file formats.  Supporting these would require enhancing each object file format
individually.  These are:

@itemize @bullet
@item global symbols in common section

The m68k MRI assembler supports common sections which are merged by the linker.
Other object file formats do not support this.  @code{@value{AS}} handles
common sections by treating them as a single common symbol.  It permits local
symbols to be defined within a common section, but it can not support global
symbols, since it has no way to describe them.

@item complex relocations

The MRI assemblers support relocations against a negated section address, and
relocations which combine the start addresses of two or more sections.  These
are not support by other object file formats.

@item @code{END} pseudo-op specifying start address

The MRI @code{END} pseudo-op permits the specification of a start address.
This is not supported by other object file formats.  The start address may
instead be specified using the @code{-e} option to the linker, or in a linker
script.

@item @code{IDNT}, @code{.ident} and @code{NAME} pseudo-ops

The MRI @code{IDNT}, @code{.ident} and @code{NAME} pseudo-ops assign a module
name to the output file.  This is not supported by other object file formats.

@item @code{ORG} pseudo-op

The m68k MRI @code{ORG} pseudo-op begins an absolute section at a given
address.  This differs from the usual @code{@value{AS}} @code{.org} pseudo-op,
which changes the location within the current section.  Absolute sections are
not supported by other object file formats.  The address of a section may be
assigned within a linker script.
@end itemize

There are some other features of the MRI assembler which are not supported by
@code{@value{AS}}, typically either because they are difficult or because they
seem of little consequence.  Some of these may be supported in future releases.

@itemize @bullet

@item EBCDIC strings

EBCDIC strings are not supported.

@item packed binary coded decimal

Packed binary coded decimal is not supported.  This means that the @code{DC.P}
and @code{DCB.P} pseudo-ops are not supported.

@item @code{FEQU} pseudo-op

The m68k @code{FEQU} pseudo-op is not supported.

@item @code{NOOBJ} pseudo-op

The m68k @code{NOOBJ} pseudo-op is not supported.

@item @code{OPT} branch control options

The m68k @code{OPT} branch control options---@code{B}, @code{BRS}, @code{BRB},
@code{BRL}, and @code{BRW}---are ignored.  @code{@value{AS}} automatically
relaxes all branches, whether forward or backward, to an appropriate size, so
these options serve no purpose.

@item @code{OPT} list control options

The following m68k @code{OPT} list control options are ignored: @code{C},
@code{CEX}, @code{CL}, @code{CRE}, @code{E}, @code{G}, @code{I}, @code{M},
@code{MEX}, @code{MC}, @code{MD}, @code{X}.

@item other @code{OPT} options

The following m68k @code{OPT} options are ignored: @code{NEST}, @code{O},
@code{OLD}, @code{OP}, @code{P}, @code{PCO}, @code{PCR}, @code{PCS}, @code{R}.

@item @code{OPT} @code{D} option is default

The m68k @code{OPT} @code{D} option is the default, unlike the MRI assembler.
@code{OPT NOD} may be used to turn it off.

@item @code{XREF} pseudo-op.

The m68k @code{XREF} pseudo-op is ignored.

@item @code{.debug} pseudo-op

The i960 @code{.debug} pseudo-op is not supported.

@item @code{.extended} pseudo-op

The i960 @code{.extended} pseudo-op is not supported.

@item @code{.list} pseudo-op.

The various options of the i960 @code{.list} pseudo-op are not supported.

@item @code{.optimize} pseudo-op

The i960 @code{.optimize} pseudo-op is not supported.

@item @code{.output} pseudo-op

The i960 @code{.output} pseudo-op is not supported.

@item @code{.setreal} pseudo-op

The i960 @code{.setreal} pseudo-op is not supported.

@node o
@section Name the Object File: @code{-o}

@kindex -o
@cindex naming object file
@cindex object file name
There is always one object file output when you run @code{@value{AS}}.  By
default it has the name
@ifset GENERIC
@ifset I960
@file{a.out} (or @file{b.out}, for Intel 960 targets only).
@end ifset
@ifclear I960

@ifclear GENERIC
@ifset I960
@file{b.out}.
@end ifset
@ifclear I960

@end ifclear
@end ifclear
You use this option (which takes exactly one filename) to give the
object file a different name.

Whatever the object file is called, @code{@value{AS}} overwrites any
existing file of the same name.

@node R
@section Join Data and Text Sections: @code{-R}

@kindex -R
@cindex data and text sections, joining
@cindex text and data sections, joining
@cindex joining text and data sections
@cindex merging text and data sections
@code{-R} tells @code{@value{AS}} to write the object file as if all
data-section data lives in the text section.  This is only done at
the very last moment:  your binary data are the same, but data
section parts are relocated differently.  The data section part of
your object file is zero bytes long because all its bytes are
appended to the text section.  (@xref{Sections,,Sections and Relocation}.)

When you specify @code{-R} it would be possible to generate shorter
address displacements (because we do not have to cross between text and
data section).  We refrain from doing this simply for compatibility with
older versions of @code{@value{AS}}.  In future, @code{-R} may work this way.

@ifset COFF
When @code{@value{AS}} is configured for COFF output,
this option is only useful if you use sections named @samp{.text} and
@samp{.data}.
@end ifset

@ifset HPPA
@code{-R} is not supported for any of the HPPA targets.  Using
@code{-R} generates a warning from @code{@value{AS}}.
@end ifset

@node statistics
@section Display Assembly Statistics: @code{--statistics}

@kindex --statistics
@cindex statistics, about assembly
@cindex time, total for assembly
@cindex space used, maximum for assembly
Use @samp{--statistics} to display two statistics about the resources used by
@code{@value{AS}}: the maximum amount of space allocated during the assembly
(in bytes), and the total execution time taken for the assembly (in @sc{cpu}
seconds).

@node v
@section Announce Version: @code{-v}

@kindex -v
@kindex -version
@cindex @code{@value{AS}} version
@cindex version of @code{@value{AS}}
You can find out what version of as is running by including the
option @samp{-v} (which you can also spell as @samp{-version}) on the
command line.

@node W
@section Suppress Warnings: @code{-W}

@kindex -W
@cindex suppressing warnings
@cindex warnings, suppressing
@code{@value{AS}} should never give a warning or error message when
assembling compiler output.  But programs written by people often
cause @code{@value{AS}} to give a warning that a particular assumption was
made.  All such warnings are directed to the standard error file.
If you use this option, no warnings are issued.  This option only
affects the warning messages: it does not change any particular of how
@code{@value{AS}} assembles your file.  Errors, which stop the assembly, are
still reported.

@node Z
@section Generate Object File in Spite of Errors: @code{-Z}
@cindex object file, after errors
@cindex errors, continuing after
After an error message, @code{@value{AS}} normally produces no output.  If for
some reason you are interested in object file output even after
@code{@value{AS}} gives an error message on your program, use the @samp{-Z}
option.  If there are any errors, @code{@value{AS}} continues anyways, and
writes an object file after a final warning message of the form @samp{@var{n}
errors, @var{m} warnings, generating bad object file.}

The @code{@value{AS}} internal preprocessor:
@itemize @bullet
@cindex whitespace, removed by preprocessor
@item
adjusts and removes extra whitespace.  It leaves one space or tab before
the keywords on a line, and turns any other whitespace on the line into
a single space.

@cindex comments, removed by preprocessor
@item
removes all comments, replacing them with a single space, or an
appropriate number of newlines.

@cindex constants, converted by preprocessor
@item

It does not do macro processing, include file handling, or
anything else you may get from your C compiler's preprocessor.  You can
do include file processing with the @code{.include} directive
(@pxref{Include,,@code{.include}}).  You can use the @sc{gnu} C compiler driver
to get other ``CPP'' style preprocessing, by giving the input file a
@samp{.S} suffix.  @xref{Overall Options,, Options Controlling the Kind of

Within an input file, you can ask for whitespace and comment removal in
specific portions of the by putting a line that says @code{#APP} before the

@cindex whitespace
@dfn{Whitespace} is one or more blanks or tabs, in any order.

@cindex comments
There are two ways of rendering comments to @code{@value{AS}}.  In both

key symbol which determines what kind of statement it is.  The key
symbol determines the syntax of the rest of the statement.  If the

directive: typically valid for any computer.  If the symbol begins with
a letter the statement is an assembly language @dfn{instruction}: it
assembles into a machine language instruction.

@cindex character constants
@cindex constants, character
There are two kinds of character constants.  A @dfn{character} stands
for one character in one byte and its value may be used in
numeric expressions.  String constants (properly called string
@emph{literals}) are potentially many bytes and their values may not be
used in arithmetic expressions.

@subsubsection Strings

@cindex string constants
@cindex constants, string
A @dfn{string} is written between double-quotes.  It may contain
double-quotes or null characters.  The way to get special characters
into a string is to @dfn{escape} these characters: precede them with
a backslash @samp{\} character.  For example @samp{\\} represents
one backslash:  the first @code{\} is an escape which tells
@code{@value{AS}} to interpret the second character literally as a backslash
(which prevents @code{@value{AS}} from recognizing the second @code{\} as an
escape character).  The complete list of escapes follows.

@cindex doublequote (@code{\"})
@item \"
Represents one @samp{"} character.  Needed in strings to represent
this character, because an unescaped @samp{"} would end the string.

@item \ @var{anything-else}
Any other character when escaped by @kbd{\} gives a warning, but
assembles as if the @samp{\} was not present.  The idea is that if
you used an escape sequence you clearly didn't want the literal
interpretation of the following character.  However @code{@value{AS}} has no
other interpretation, so @code{@value{AS}} knows it is giving you the wrong
code and warns you of the fact.
@end table

Which characters are escapable, and what those escapes represent,
varies widely among assemblers.  The current set is what we think
the BSD 4.2 assembler recognizes, and is a subset of what most C
compilers recognize.  If you are in doubt, do not use an escape
sequence.

A single character may be written as a single quote immediately
followed by that character.  The same escapes apply to characters as
to strings.  So if you want to write the character backslash, you
must write @kbd{'\\} where the first @code{\} escapes the second
@code{\}.  As you can see, the quote is an acute accent, not a
grave accent.  A newline

and does not count as the end of a statement.  The value of a character
constant in a numeric expression is the machine's byte-wide code for
that character.  @code{@value{AS}} assumes your character code is ASCII:

A @dfn{bignum} has the same syntax and semantics as an integer

indirect: a decimal floating point number from the text is converted by
@code{@value{AS}} to a generic binary floating point number of more than
sufficient precision.  This generic floating point number is converted
to a particular computer's floating point format (or formats) by a
portion of @code{@value{AS}} specialized to that computer.

@node Secs Background
@section Background

Roughly, a section is a range of addresses, with no gaps; all data
``in'' those addresses is treated the same for some particular purpose.
For example there may be a ``read only'' section.

@cindex linker, and assembler
@cindex assembler, and linker
The linker @code{@value{LD}} reads many object files (partial programs) and
combines their contents to form a runnable program.  When @code{@value{AS}}
emits an object file, the partial program is assumed to start at address 0.
@code{@value{LD}} assigns the final addresses for the partial program, so that
different partial programs do not overlap.  This is actually an
oversimplification, but it suffices to explain how @code{@value{AS}} uses
sections.

@code{@value{LD}} moves blocks of bytes of your program to their run-time
addresses.  These blocks slide to their run-time addresses as rigid
units; their length does not change and neither does the order of bytes
within them.  Such a rigid unit is called a @emph{section}.  Assigning
run-time addresses to sections is called @dfn{relocation}.  It includes
the task of adjusting mentions of object-file addresses so they refer to
the proper run-time addresses.
@ifset H8
For the H8/300 and H8/500,
and for the Hitachi SH,
@code{@value{AS}} pads sections if needed to
ensure they end on a word (sixteen bit) boundary.
@end ifset

@cindex standard @code{@value{AS}} sections
An object file written by @code{@value{AS}} has at least three sections, any
of which may be empty.  These are named @dfn{text}, @dfn{data} and
@dfn{bss} sections.

@ifset COFF
@ifset GENERIC
When it generates COFF output,
@end ifset
@code{@value{AS}} can also generate whatever other named sections you specify
using the @samp{.section} directive (@pxref{Section,,@code{.section}}).
If you do not use any directives that place output in the @samp{.text}
or @samp{.data} sections, these sections still exist, but are empty.
@end ifset

@ifset HPPA
@ifset GENERIC
When @code{@value{AS}} generates SOM or ELF output for the HPPA,
@end ifset
@code{@value{AS}} can also generate whatever other named sections you
specify using the @samp{.space} and @samp{.subspace} directives.  See
@cite{HP9000 Series 800 Assembly Language Reference Manual}
(HP 92432-90001) for details on the @samp{.space} and @samp{.subspace}
assembler directives.

@ifset SOM
Additionally, @code{@value{AS}} uses different names for the standard
text, data, and bss sections when generating SOM output.  Program text
is placed into the @samp{$CODE$} section, data into @samp{$DATA$}, and
BSS into @samp{$BSS$}.
@end ifset
@end ifset

Within the object file, the text section starts at address @code{0}, the
data section follows, and the bss section follows the data section.

@ifset HPPA
When generating either SOM or ELF output files on the HPPA, the text
section starts at address @code{0}, the data section at address
@code{0x4000000}, and the bss section follows the data section.
@end ifset

To let @code{@value{LD}} know which data changes when the sections are
relocated, and how to change that data, @code{@value{AS}} also writes to the
object file details of the relocation needed.  To perform relocation
@code{@value{LD}} must know, each time an address in the object
file is mentioned:
@itemize @bullet
@item
Where in the object file is the beginning of this reference to
an address?
@item
How long (in bytes) is this reference?
@item
Which section does the address refer to?  What is the numeric value of
@display
(@var{address}) @minus{} (@var{start-address of section})?
@end display
@item
Is the reference to an address ``Program-Counter relative''?
@end itemize

@cindex addresses, format of
@cindex section-relative addressing
In fact, every address @code{@value{AS}} ever uses is expressed as
@display
(@var{section}) + (@var{offset into section})
@end display
@noindent
Further, most expressions @code{@value{AS}} computes have this section-relative
nature.
@ifset SOM
(For some object formats, such as SOM for the HPPA, some expressions are
symbol-relative instead.)
@end ifset

In this manual we use the notation @{@var{secname} @var{N}@} to mean ``offset
@var{N} into section @var{secname}.''

Apart from text, data and bss sections you need to know about the
@dfn{absolute} section.  When @code{@value{LD}} mixes partial programs,
addresses in the absolute section remain unchanged.  For example, address
@code{@{absolute 0@}} is ``relocated'' to run-time address 0 by
@code{@value{LD}}.  Although the linker never arranges two partial programs'
data sections with overlapping addresses after linking, @emph{by definition}
their absolute sections must overlap.  Address @code{@{absolute@ 239@}} in one
part of a program is always the same address when the program is running as
address @code{@{absolute@ 239@}} in any other part of the program.

The idea of sections is extended to the @dfn{undefined} section.  Any
address whose section is unknown at assembly time is by definition
rendered @{undefined @var{U}@}---where @var{U} is filled in later.
Since numbers are always defined, the only way to generate an undefined
address is to mention an undefined symbol.  A reference to a named
common block would be such a symbol: its value is unknown at assembly
time so it has section @emph{undefined}.

By analogy the word @emph{section} is used to describe groups of sections in
the linked program.  @code{@value{LD}} puts all partial programs' text
sections in contiguous addresses in the linked program.  It is
customary to refer to the @emph{text section} of a program, meaning all
the addresses of all partial programs' text sections.  Likewise for
data and bss sections.

Some sections are manipulated by @code{@value{LD}}; others are invented for
use of @code{@value{AS}} and have no meaning except during assembly.

@node Ld Sections
@section @value{LD} Sections
@code{@value{LD}} deals with just four kinds of sections, summarized below.

@table @strong

@ifset COFF
@cindex named sections
@cindex sections, named
@item named sections
@end ifset
@ifset aout-bout
@cindex text section
@cindex data section
@itemx text section
@itemx data section
@end ifset
These sections hold your program.  @code{@value{AS}} and @code{@value{LD}} treat them as
separate but equal sections.  Anything you can say of one section is
true another.
@ifset aout-bout
When the program is running, however, it is
customary for the text section to be unalterable.  The
text section is often shared among processes: it contains
instructions, constants and the like.  The data section of a running
program is usually alterable: for example, C variables would be stored
in the data section.
@end ifset

@cindex bss section
@item bss section
This section contains zeroed bytes when your program begins running.  It
is used to hold unitialized variables or common storage.  The length of
each partial program's bss section is important, but because it starts
out containing zeroed bytes there is no need to store explicit zero
bytes in the object file.  The bss section was invented to eliminate
those explicit zeros from object files.

@cindex absolute section
@item absolute section
Address 0 of this section is always ``relocated'' to runtime address 0.
This is useful if you want to refer to an address that @code{@value{LD}} must
not change when relocating.  In this sense we speak of absolute
addresses being ``unrelocatable'': they do not change during relocation.

@cindex undefined section
@item undefined section
This ``section'' is a catch-all for address references to objects not in
the preceding sections.
@c FIXME: ref to some other doc on obj-file formats could go here.

use @dfn{subsections} for this purpose.  Within each section, there can be
numbered subsections with values from 0 to 8192.  Objects assembled into the
same subsection go into the object file together with other objects in the same
subsection.  For example, a compiler might want to store constants in the text
section, but might not want to have them interspersed with the program being
assembled.  In this case, the compiler could issue a @samp{.text 0} before each
section of code being output, and a @samp{.text 1} before each group of
constants being output.

Subsections are optional.  If you do not use subsections, everything
goes in subsection number zero.

@ifset GENERIC
Each subsection is zero-padded up to a multiple of four bytes.
(Subsections may be padded a different amount on different flavors
of @code{@value{AS}}.)
@end ifset
@ifclear GENERIC
@ifset H8
On the H8/300 and H8/500 platforms, each subsection is zero-padded to a word
boundary (two bytes).
The same is true on the Hitachi SH.
@end ifset
@ifset I960
@c FIXME section padding (alignment)?
@c Rich Pixley says padding here depends on target obj code format; that
@c doesn't seem particularly useful to say without further elaboration,
@c so for now I say nothing about it.  If this is a generic BFD issue,
@c these paragraphs might need to vanish from this manual, and be
@c discussed in BFD chapter of binutils (or some such).
@end ifset
@ifset A29K
On the AMD 29K family, no particular padding is added to section or
subsection sizes; @value{AS} forces no alignment on this platform.
@end ifset
@end ifclear

Subsections appear in your object file in numeric order, lowest numbered
to highest.  (All this to be compatible with other people's assemblers.)
The object file contains no representation of subsections; @code{@value{LD}} and
other programs that manipulate object files see no trace of them.
They just see all your text subsections as a text section, and all your
data subsections as a data section.

To specify which subsection you want subsequent statements assembled
into, use a numeric argument to specify it, in a @samp{.text
@var{expression}} or a @samp{.data @var{expression}} statement.
@ifset COFF
@ifset GENERIC
When generating COFF output, you
@end ifset
@ifclear GENERIC
You
@end ifclear
can also use an extra subsection
argument with arbitrary named sections: @samp{.section @var{name},
@var{expression}}.
@end ifset
@var{Expression} should be an absolute expression.
(@xref{Expressions}.)  If you just say @samp{.text} then @samp{.text 0}
is assumed.  Likewise @samp{.data} means @samp{.data 0}.  Assembly
begins in @code{text 0}.  For instance:
@smallexample
.text 0     # The default subsection is text 0 anyway.
.ascii "This lives in the first text subsection. *"
.text 1
.ascii "But this lives in the second text subsection."
.data 0
.ascii "This lives in the data section,"
.ascii "in the first data subsection."
.text 0
.ascii "This lives in the first text section,"
.ascii "immediately following the asterisk (*)."
@end smallexample

Each section has a @dfn{location counter} incremented by one for every byte
assembled into that section.  Because subsections are merely a convenience
restricted to @code{@value{AS}} there is no concept of a subsection location
counter.  There is no way to directly manipulate a location counter---but the
@code{.align} directive changes it, and any label definition captures its
current value.  The location counter of the section where statements are being
assembled is said to be the @dfn{active} location counter.

@node bss
@section bss Section

@cindex bss section
@cindex common variable storage
The bss section is used for local common variable storage.
You may allocate address space in the bss section, but you may
not dictate data to load into it before your program executes.  When
your program starts running, all the contents of the bss
section are zeroed bytes.

Addresses in the bss section are allocated with special directives; you
may not assemble anything directly into the bss section.  Hence there
are no bss subsections. @xref{Comm,,@code{.comm}},
@pxref{Lcomm,,@code{.lcomm}}.

@node Symbols

@cindex symbols
Symbols are a central concept: the programmer uses symbols to name
things, the linker uses symbols to link, and the debugger uses symbols
to debug.

@node Labels
@section Labels

@cindex labels
A @dfn{label} is written as a symbol immediately followed by a colon
@samp{:}.  The symbol then represents the current value of the
active location counter, and is, for example, a suitable instruction
operand.  You are warned if you use the same symbol to represent two
different locations: the first definition overrides any other
definitions.

@ifset HPPA
On the HPPA, the usual form for a label need not be immediately followed by a
colon, but instead must start in column zero.  Only one label may be defined on
a single line.  To work around this, the HPPA version of @code{@value{AS}} also
provides a special directive @code{.label} for defining labels more flexibly.
@end ifset

@node Setting Symbols
@section Giving Symbols Other Values

@cindex assigning values to symbols
@cindex symbol values, assigning
A symbol can be given an arbitrary value by writing a symbol, followed
by an equals sign @samp{=}, followed by an expression
(@pxref{Expressions}).  This is equivalent to using the @code{.set}
directive.  @xref{Set,,@code{.set}}.

@node Symbol Names
@section Symbol Names

@cindex symbol names
@cindex names, symbol
@ifclear SPECIAL-SYMS
Symbol names begin with a letter or with one of @samp{._}.  On most
machines, you can also use @code{$} in symbol names; exceptions are
noted in @ref{Machine Dependencies}.  That character may be followed by any
string of digits, letters, dollar signs (unless otherwise noted in
@ref{Machine Dependencies}), and underscores.
@end ifclear
@ifset A29K
For the AMD 29K family, @samp{?} is also allowed in the
body of a symbol name, though not at its beginning.
@end ifset

@ifset SPECIAL-SYMS
@ifset H8
Symbol names begin with a letter or with one of @samp{._}.  On the
Hitachi SH or the
H8/500, you can also use @code{$} in symbol names.  That character may
be followed by any string of digits, letters, dollar signs (save on the
H8/300), and underscores.
@end ifset
@end ifset

Case of letters is significant: @code{foo} is a different symbol name
than @code{Foo}.

Each symbol has exactly one name.  Each name in an assembly language program
refers to exactly one symbol.  You may use that symbol name any number of times
in a program.

@subheading Local Symbol Names

@cindex local symbol names
@cindex symbol names, local
@cindex temporary symbol names
@cindex symbol names, temporary
Local symbols help compilers and programmers use names temporarily.
There are ten local symbol names, which are re-used throughout the
program.  You may refer to them using the names @samp{0} @samp{1}
@dots{} @samp{9}.  To define a local symbol, write a label of the form
@samp{@b{N}:} (where @b{N} represents any digit).  To refer to the most
recent previous definition of that symbol write @samp{@b{N}b}, using the
same digit as when you defined the label.  To refer to the next
definition of a local label, write @samp{@b{N}f}---where @b{N} gives you
a choice of 10 forward references.  The @samp{b} stands for
``backwards'' and the @samp{f} stands for ``forwards''.

Local symbols are not emitted by the current @sc{gnu} C compiler.

There is no restriction on how you can use these labels, but
remember that at any point in the assembly you can refer to at most
10 prior local labels and to at most 10 forward local labels.

Local symbol names are only a notation device.  They are immediately
transformed into more conventional symbol names before the assembler
uses them.  The symbol names stored in the symbol table, appearing in
error messages and optionally emitted to the object file have these
parts:

@table @code
@item L
All local labels begin with @samp{L}. Normally both @code{@value{AS}} and
@code{@value{LD}} forget symbols that start with @samp{L}. These labels are
used for symbols you are never intended to see.  If you use the
@samp{-L} option then @code{@value{AS}} retains these symbols in the
object file. If you also instruct @code{@value{LD}} to retain these symbols,
you may use them in debugging.

@item @var{digit}
If the label is written @samp{0:} then the digit is @samp{0}.
If the label is written @samp{1:} then the digit is @samp{1}.
And so on up through @samp{9:}.

@item @ctrl{A}
This unusual character is included so you do not accidentally invent
a symbol of the same name.  The character has ASCII value
@samp{\001}.

@item @emph{ordinal number}
This is a serial number to keep the labels distinct.  The first
@samp{0:} gets the number @samp{1}; The 15th @samp{0:} gets the
number @samp{15}; @emph{etc.}.  Likewise for the other labels @samp{1:}
through @samp{9:}.
@end table

For instance, the first @code{1:} is named @code{L1@ctrl{A}1}, the 44th
@code{3:} is named @code{L3@ctrl{A}44}.

@node Dot
@section The Special Dot Symbol

@cindex dot (symbol)
@cindex @code{.} (symbol)
@cindex current address
@cindex location counter
The special symbol @samp{.} refers to the current address that
@code{@value{AS}} is assembling into.  Thus, the expression @samp{melvin:
.long .} defines @code{melvin} to contain its own address.
Assigning a value to @code{.} is treated the same as a @code{.org}
directive.  Thus, the expression @samp{.=.+4} is the same as saying
@ifclear no-space-dir
@samp{.space 4}.
@end ifclear
@ifset no-space-dir
@ifset A29K
@samp{.block 4}.

The detailed definitions are in @file{a.out.h}.
@end ifset

If you use a symbol without defining it, @code{@value{AS}} assumes zero for
all these attributes, and probably won't warn you.  This makes the
symbol an externally defined symbol, which is generally what you
would want.

@node Symbol Value
@subsection Value

@cindex value of a symbol
@cindex symbol value
The value of a symbol is (usually) 32 bits.  For a symbol which labels a
location in the text, data, bss or absolute sections the value is the
number of addresses from the start of that section to the label.
Naturally for text, data and bss sections the value of a symbol changes
as @code{@value{LD}} changes section base addresses during linking.  Absolute
symbols' values do not change during linking: that is why they are
called absolute.

The value of an undefined symbol is treated in a special way.  If it is
0 then the symbol is not defined in this assembler source file, and
@code{@value{LD}} tries to determine its value from other files linked into the
same program.  You make this kind of symbol simply by mentioning a symbol
name without defining it.  A non-zero value represents a @code{.comm}
common declaration.  The value is how much common storage to reserve, in
bytes (addresses).  The symbol refers to the first address of the
allocated storage.

@node Symbol Type
@subsection Type

@cindex type of a symbol
@cindex symbol type
The type attribute of a symbol contains relocation (section)
information, any flag settings indicating that a symbol is external, and

The result of an expression must be an absolute number, or else an offset into

enough information when @code{@value{AS}} sees the expression to know its
section, a second pass over the source program might be necessary to interpret
the expression---but the second pass is currently not implemented.
@code{@value{AS}} aborts with an error message in this situation.

@subsection Arguments

@cindex expression arguments
@cindex arguments in expressions
@cindex operands in expressions
@cindex arithmetic operands
@dfn{Arguments} are symbols, numbers or subexpressions.  In other
contexts arguments are sometimes called ``arithmetic operands''.  In
this manual, to avoid confusing them with the ``instruction operands'' of
the machine language, we use the term ``argument'' to refer to parts of
expressions only, reserving the word ``operand'' to refer only to machine
instruction operands.

Symbols are evaluated to yield @{@var{section} @var{NNN}@} where
@var{section} is one of text, data, bss, absolute,
or undefined.  @var{NNN} is a signed, 2's complement 32 bit
integer.

Numbers are usually integers.

A number can be a flonum or bignum.  In this case, you are warned
that only the low order 32 bits are used, and @code{@value{AS}} pretends
these 32 bits are an integer.  You may write integer-manipulating
instructions that act on exotic constants, compatible with other
assemblers.

@cindex subexpressions
Subexpressions are a left parenthesis @samp{(} followed by an integer
expression, followed by a right parenthesis @samp{)}; or a prefix
operator followed by an argument.

@node Operators

@node Abort
@section @code{.abort}

@cindex @code{abort} directive
@cindex stopping the assembly
This directive stops the assembly immediately.  It is for
compatibility with other assemblers.  The original idea was that the
assembly language source would be piped into the assembler.  If the sender
of the source quit, it could use this directive tells @code{@value{AS}} to
quit also.  One day @code{.abort} will not be supported.

@ifset COFF
@node ABORT
@section @code{.ABORT}

@cindex @code{ABORT} directive
When producing COFF output, @code{@value{AS}} accepts this directive as a
synonym for @samp{.abort}.

@ifset BOUT
When producing @code{b.out} output, @code{@value{AS}} accepts this directive,
but ignores it.
@end ifset
@end ifset

@node Align
@section @code{.align @var{abs-expr} , @var{abs-expr}}

@cindex padding the location counter
@cindex @code{align} directive
Pad the location counter (in the current subsection) to a particular
storage boundary.  The first expression (which must be absolute) is the
alignment required, as described below.
The second expression (also absolute) gives the value to be stored in
the padding bytes.  It (and the comma) may be omitted.  If it is
omitted, the padding bytes are zero.  
For the alpha, if the section is marked as containing code and the
padding expression is omitted, then the space is filled with no-ops.

The way the required alignment is specified varies from system to system.
For the a29k, hppa, m68k, m88k, w65, sparc, and Hitachi SH, and i386 using ELF
format,
the first expression is the
alignment request in bytes.  For example @samp{.align 8} advances
the location counter until it is a multiple of 8.  If the location counter
is already a multiple of 8, no change is needed.

For other systems, including the i386 using a.out format, it is the
number of low-order zero bits the location counter must have after
advancement.  For example @samp{.align 3} advances the location
counter until it a multiple of 8.  If the location counter is already a
multiple of 8, no change is needed.

This inconsistency is due to the different behaviors of the various
native assemblers for these systems which GAS must emulate.
GAS also provides @code{.balign} and @code{.p2align} directives,
described later, which have a consistent behavior across all
architectures (but are specific to GAS).

@node App-File
@section @code{.app-file @var{string}}

@cindex logical file name
@cindex file name, logical
@cindex @code{app-file} directive
@code{.app-file}
@ifclear no-file-dir
(which may also be spelled @samp{.file})
@end ifclear
tells @code{@value{AS}} that we are about to start a new
logical file.  @var{string} is the new file name.  In general, the
filename is recognized whether or not it is surrounded by quotes @samp{"};
but if you wish to specify an empty file name is permitted,
you must give the quotes--@code{""}.  This statement may go away in
future: it is only recognized to be compatible with old @code{@value{AS}}
programs.@refill

@node Ascii
@section @code{.ascii "@var{string}"}@dots{}

@cindex @code{ascii} directive
@cindex string literals
@code{.ascii} expects zero or more string literals (@pxref{Strings})
separated by commas.  It assembles each string (with no automatic
trailing zero byte) into consecutive addresses.

@node Asciz
@section @code{.asciz "@var{string}"}@dots{}

@cindex @code{asciz} directive
@cindex zero-terminated strings
@cindex null-terminated strings
@code{.asciz} is just like @code{.ascii}, but each string is followed by
a zero byte.  The ``z'' in @samp{.asciz} stands for ``zero''.

@node Balign
@section @code{.balign[wl] @var{abs-expr} , @var{abs-expr}}

@cindex padding the location counter given number of bytes
@cindex @code{balign} directive
Pad the location counter (in the current subsection) to a particular
storage boundary.  The first expression (which must be absolute) is the
alignment request in bytes.  For example @samp{.balign 8} advances
the location counter until it is a multiple of 8.  If the location counter
is already a multiple of 8, no change is needed.

The second expression (also absolute) gives the value to be stored in
the padding bytes.  It (and the comma) may be omitted.  If it is
omitted, the padding bytes are zero.

@cindex @code{balignw} directive
@cindex @code{balignl} directive
The @code{.balignw} and @code{.balignl} directives are variants of the
@code{.balign} directive.  The @code{.balignw} directive treats the fill
pattern as a two byte word value.  The @code{.balignl} directives treats the
fill pattern as a four byte longword value.  For example, @code{.balignw
4,0x368d} will align to a multiple of 4.  If it skips two bytes, they will be
filled in with the value 0x368d (the exact placement of the bytes depends upon
the endianness of the processor).  If it skips 1 or 3 bytes, the fill value is
undefined.

@node Byte
@section @code{.byte @var{expressions}}

@cindex @code{byte} directive
@cindex integers, one byte
@code{.byte} expects zero or more expressions, separated by commas.
Each expression is assembled into the next byte.

@node Comm
@section @code{.comm @var{symbol} , @var{length} }

@cindex @code{comm} directive
@cindex symbol, common
@code{.comm} declares a named common area in the bss section.  Normally
@code{@value{LD}} reserves memory addresses for it during linking, so no partial
program defines the location of the symbol.  Use @code{.comm} to tell
@code{@value{LD}} that it must be at least @var{length} bytes long.  @code{@value{LD}}
allocates space for each @code{.comm} symbol that is at least as
long as the longest @code{.comm} request in any of the partial programs
linked.  @var{length} is an absolute expression.

@ifset HPPA
The syntax for @code{.comm} differs slightly on the HPPA.  The syntax is
@samp{@var{symbol} .comm, @var{length}}; @var{symbol} is optional.
@end ifset

@node Data
@section @code{.data @var{subsection}}

@cindex @code{data} directive
@code{.data} tells @code{@value{AS}} to assemble the following statements onto the
end of the data subsection numbered @var{subsection} (which is an
absolute expression).  If @var{subsection} is omitted, it defaults
to zero.

@ifset COFF

to the low 16 bits of an absolute expression.

@ifset COFF
The @samp{.desc} directive is not available when @code{@value{AS}} is
configured for COFF output; it is only for @code{a.out} or @code{b.out}
object format.  For the sake of compatibility, @code{@value{AS}} accepts
it, but produces no output, when configured for COFF.
@end ifset
@end ifset

@node Dim
@section @code{.dim}

@cindex @code{dim} directive
@cindex COFF auxiliary symbol information
@cindex auxiliary symbol information, COFF
This directive is generated by compilers to include auxiliary debugging
information in the symbol table.  It is only permitted inside
@code{.def}/@code{.endef} pairs.
@ifset BOUT

@samp{.dim} is only meaningful when generating COFF format output; when

@node Else
@section @code{.else}

@cindex @code{else} directive
@code{.else} is part of the @code{@value{AS}} support for conditional
assembly; @pxref{If,,@code{.if}}.  It marks the beginning of a section
of code to be assembled if the condition for the preceding @code{.if}
was false.

@node Extern
@section @code{.extern}

@cindex @code{extern} directive
@code{.extern} is accepted in the source program---for compatibility
with other assemblers---but it is ignored.  @code{@value{AS}} treats
all undefined symbols as external.

@ifclear no-file-dir
@node File
@section @code{.file @var{string}}

@cindex @code{file} directive
@cindex logical file name
@cindex file name, logical
@code{.file} (which may also be spelled @samp{.app-file}) tells
@code{@value{AS}} that we are about to start a new logical file.
@var{string} is the new file name.  In general, the filename is
recognized whether or not it is surrounded by quotes @samp{"}; but if
you wish to specify an empty file name, you must give the
quotes--@code{""}.  This statement may go away in future: it is only
recognized to be compatible with old @code{@value{AS}} programs.
@ifset A29K

@node Fill
@section @code{.fill @var{repeat} , @var{size} , @var{value}}

@cindex @code{fill} directive
@cindex writing patterns in memory
@cindex patterns, writing in memory
@var{result}, @var{size} and @var{value} are absolute expressions.
This emits @var{repeat} copies of @var{size} bytes.  @var{Repeat}
may be zero or more.  @var{Size} may be zero or more, but if it is
more than 8, then it is deemed to have the value 8, compatible with
other people's assemblers.  The contents of each @var{repeat} bytes
is taken from an 8-byte number.  The highest order 4 bytes are
zero.  The lowest order 4 bytes are @var{value} rendered in the
byte-order of an integer on the computer @code{@value{AS}} is assembling for.
Each @var{size} bytes in a repetition is taken from the lowest order
@var{size} bytes of this number.  Again, this bizarre behavior is
compatible with other people's assemblers.

@var{size} and @var{value} are optional.
If the second comma and @var{value} are absent, @var{value} is
assumed zero.  If the first comma and following tokens are absent,
@var{size} is assumed to be 1.

@node Float
@section @code{.float @var{flonums}}

@cindex floating point numbers (single)
@cindex @code{float} directive
This directive assembles zero or more flonums, separated by commas.  It

@node Global
@section @code{.global @var{symbol}}, @code{.globl @var{symbol}}

@cindex @code{global} directive
@cindex symbol, making visible to linker
@code{.global} makes the symbol visible to @code{@value{LD}}.  If you define
@var{symbol} in your partial program, its value is made available to
other partial programs that are linked with it.  Otherwise,
@var{symbol} takes its attributes from a symbol of the same name
from another file linked into the same program.

Both spellings (@samp{.globl} and @samp{.global}) are accepted, for
compatibility with other assemblers.

@ifset HPPA
On the HPPA, @code{.global} is not always enough to make it accessible to other
partial programs.  You may need the HPPA-only @code{.EXPORT} directive as well.
@xref{HPPA Directives,, HPPA Assembler Directives}.

@node Ident
@section @code{.ident}

@cindex @code{ident} directive
This directive is used by some assemblers to place tags in object files.
@code{@value{AS}} simply accepts the directive for source-file
compatibility with such assemblers, but does not actually emit anything
for it.

@node If
@section @code{.if @var{absolute expression}}

@cindex conditional assembly
@cindex @code{if} directive
@code{.if} marks the beginning of a section of code which is only
considered part of the source program being assembled if the argument
(which must be an @var{absolute expression}) is non-zero.  The end of
the conditional section of code must be marked by @code{.endif}
(@pxref{Endif,,@code{.endif}}); optionally, you may include code for the
alternative condition, flagged by @code{.else} (@pxref{Else,,@code{.else}}).

The following variants of @code{.if} are also supported:
@table @code
@cindex @code{ifdef} directive
@item .ifdef @var{symbol}
Assembles the following section of code if the specified @var{symbol}
has been defined.

@ignore
@cindex @code{ifeqs} directive
@item .ifeqs

included file is reached, assembly of the original file continues.  You
can control the search paths used with the @samp{-I} command-line option

around @var{file}.

@node Int
@section @code{.int @var{expressions}}

@cindex @code{int} directive
@cindex integers, 32-bit
Expect zero or more @var{expressions}, of any section, separated by commas.
For each expression, emit a number that, at run time, is the value of that
expression.  The byte order and bit size of the number depends on what kind
of target the assembly is for.

@ifclear GENERIC
@ifset H8
On the H8/500 and most forms of the H8/300, @code{.int} emits 16-bit

@node Irp
@section @code{.irp @var{symbol},@var{values}}@dots{}

@cindex @code{irp} directive
Evaluate a sequence of statements assigning different values to @var{symbol}.
The sequence of statements starts at the @code{.irp} directive, and is
terminated by an @code{.endr} directive.  For each @var{value}, @var{symbol} is
set to @var{value}, and the sequence of statements is assembled.  If no
@var{value} is listed, the sequence of statements is assembled once, with
@var{symbol} set to the null string.  To refer to @var{symbol} within the
sequence of statements, use @var{\symbol}.

For example, assembling

@example
        .irp    param,1,2,3
        move    d\param,sp@@-
        .endr
@end example

@end example

@node Irpc
@section @code{.irpc @var{symbol},@var{values}}@dots{}

@cindex @code{irpc} directive
Evaluate a sequence of statements assigning different values to @var{symbol}.
The sequence of statements starts at the @code{.irpc} directive, and is
terminated by an @code{.endr} directive.  For each character in @var{value},
@var{symbol} is set to the character, and the sequence of statements is

@cindex local common symbols
@cindex symbols, local common
Reserve @var{length} (an absolute expression) bytes for a local common
denoted by @var{symbol}.  The section and value of @var{symbol} are
those of the new local common.  The addresses are allocated in the bss

@cindex @code{linkonce} directive
@cindex common sections
Mark the current section so that the linker only includes a single copy of it.
This may be used to include the same section in several different object files,
but ensure that the linker will only include it once in the final output file.
The @code{.linkonce} pseudo-op must be used for each instance of the section.
Duplicate sections are detected based on the section name, so it should be
unique.

This directive is only supported by a few object file formats; as of this
writing, the only object file format which supports it is the Portable
Executable format used on Windows NT.

The @var{type} argument is optional.  If specified, it must be one of the
following strings.  For example:
@smallexample
.linkonce same_size
@end smallexample
Not all types may be supported on all object file formats.

@table @code
@item discard
Silently discard duplicate sections.  This is the default.

@item one_only

@node MRI
@section @code{.mri @var{val}}

@cindex @code{mri} directive
@cindex MRI mode, temporarily
If @var{val} is non-zero, this tells @code{@value{AS}} to enter MRI mode.  If
@var{val} is zero, this tells @code{@value{AS}} to exit MRI mode.  This change
affects code assembled until the next @code{.mri} directive, or until the end
of the file.  @xref{M, MRI mode, MRI mode}.

@node List
@section @code{.list}

@cindex @code{list} directive
@cindex listing control, turning on
Control (in conjunction with the @code{.nolist} directive) whether or
not assembly listings are generated.  These two directives maintain an
internal counter (which is zero initially).   @code{.list} increments the
counter, and @code{.nolist} decrements it.  Assembly listings are
generated whenever the counter is greater than zero.

By default, listings are disabled.  When you enable them (with the
@samp{-a} command line option; @pxref{Invoking,,Command-Line Options}),
the initial value of the listing counter is one.

@node Long
@section @code{.long @var{expressions}}

@cindex @code{long} directive
@code{.long} is the same as @samp{.int}, @pxref{Int,,@code{.int}}.

@ignore
@c no one seems to know what this is for or whether this description is
@c what it really ought to do
@node Lsym
@section @code{.lsym @var{symbol}, @var{expression}}

@cindex @code{lsym} directive
@cindex symbol, not referenced in assembly
@code{.lsym} creates a new symbol named @var{symbol}, but does not put it in
the hash table, ensuring it cannot be referenced by name during the
rest of the assembly.  This sets the attributes of the symbol to be
the same as the expression value:
@smallexample
@var{other} = @var{descriptor} = 0
@var{type} = @r{(section of @var{expression})}
@var{value} = @var{expression}
@end smallexample
@noindent
The new symbol is not flagged as external.
@end ignore

@node Macro
@section @code{.macro}

@cindex macros
The commands @code{.macro} and @code{.endm} allow you to define macros that
generate assembly output.  For example, this definition specifies a macro
@code{sum} that puts a sequence of numbers into memory:

@example
        .macro  sum from=0, to=5
        .long   \from
        .if     \to-\from
        sum     "(\from+1)",\to
        .endif
        .endm
@end example

@noindent
With that definition, @samp{SUM 0,5} is equivalent to this assembly input:

@example
        .long   0
        .long   1
        .long   2
        .long   3
        .long   4
        .long   5
@end example

@ftable @code
@item .macro @var{macname}
@itemx .macro @var{macname} @var{macargs} @dots{}
@cindex @code{macro} directive
Begin the definition of a macro called @var{macname}.  If your macro
definition requires arguments, specify their names after the macro name,
separated by commas or spaces.  You can supply a default value for any
macro argument by following the name with @samp{=@var{deflt}}.  For
example, these are all valid @code{.macro} statements:

@table @code
@item .macro comm
Begin the definition of a macro called @code{comm}, which takes no
arguments.

@item .macro plus1 p, p1
@itemx .macro plus1 p p1
Either statement begins the definition of a macro called @code{plus1},
which takes two arguments; within the macro definition, write
@samp{\p} or @samp{\p1} to evaluate the arguments.

@item .macro reserve_str p1=0 p2
Begin the definition of a macro called @code{reserve_str}, with two
arguments.  The first argument has a default value, but not the second.
After the definition is complete, you can call the macro either as
@samp{reserve_str @var{a},@var{b}} (with @samp{\p1} evaluating to
@var{a} and @samp{\p2} evaluating to @var{b}), or as @samp{reserve_str
,@var{b}} (with @samp{\p1} evaluating as the default, in this case
@samp{0}, and @samp{\p2} evaluating to @var{b}).
@end table

When you call a macro, you can specify the argument values either by
position, or by keyword.  For example, @samp{sum 9,17} is equivalent to
@samp{sum to=17, from=9}.

@item .endm
@cindex @code{endm} directive
Mark the end of a macro definition.

@item .exitm
@cindex @code{exitm} directive
Exit early from the current macro definition.

@cindex number of macros executed
@cindex macros, count executed
@item \@@
@code{@value{AS}} maintains a counter of how many macros it has
executed in this pseudo-variable; you can copy that number to your
output with @samp{\@@}, but @emph{only within a macro definition}.

@ignore
@item LOCAL @var{name} [ , @dots{} ]
@emph{Warning: @code{LOCAL} is only available if you select ``alternate
macro syntax'' with @samp{-a} or @samp{--alternate}.}  @xref{Alternate,,
Alternate macro syntax}.

Generate a string replacement for each of the @var{name} arguments, and
replace any instances of @var{name} in each macro expansion.  The
replacement string is unique in the assembly, and different for each
separate macro expansion.  @code{LOCAL} allows you to write macros that
define symbols, without fear of conflict between separate macro expansions.

@node Nolist
@section @code{.nolist}

@cindex @code{nolist} directive
@cindex listing control, turning off
Control (in conjunction with the @code{.list} directive) whether or
not assembly listings are generated.  These two directives maintain an
internal counter (which is zero initially).   @code{.list} increments the
counter, and @code{.nolist} decrements it.  Assembly listings are
generated whenever the counter is greater than zero.

@node Octa
@section @code{.octa @var{bignums}}

@c FIXME: double size emitted for "octa" on i960, others?  Or warn?
@cindex @code{octa} directive
@cindex integer, 16-byte
@cindex sixteen byte integer
This directive expects zero or more bignums, separated by commas.  For each
bignum, it emits a 16-byte integer.

The term ``octa'' comes from contexts in which a ``word'' is two bytes;
hence @emph{octa}-word for 16 bytes.

@node Org
@section @code{.org @var{new-lc} , @var{fill}}

@cindex @code{org} directive
@cindex location counter, advancing
@cindex advancing location counter
@cindex current address, advancing
Advance the location counter of the current section to
@var{new-lc}.  @var{new-lc} is either an absolute expression or an
expression with the same section as the current subsection.  That is,
you can't use @code{.org} to cross sections: if @var{new-lc} has the
wrong section, the @code{.org} directive is ignored.  To be compatible
with former assemblers, if the section of @var{new-lc} is absolute,
@code{@value{AS}} issues a warning, then pretends the section of @var{new-lc}
is the same as the current subsection.

@code{.org} may only increase the location counter, or leave it
unchanged; you cannot use @code{.org} to move the location counter
backwards.

@c double negative used below "not undefined" because this is a specific
@c reference to "undefined" (as SEG_UNKNOWN is called in this manual)
@c section. doc@cygnus.com 18feb91
Because @code{@value{AS}} tries to assemble programs in one pass, @var{new-lc}
may not be undefined.  If you really detest this restriction we eagerly await
a chance to share your improved assembler.

Beware that the origin is relative to the start of the section, not
to the start of the subsection.  This is compatible with other
people's assemblers.

When the location counter (of the current subsection) is advanced, the
intervening bytes are filled with @var{fill} which should be an
absolute expression.  If the comma and @var{fill} are omitted,
@var{fill} defaults to zero.

@node P2align
@section @code{.p2align[wl] @var{abs-expr} , @var{abs-expr}}

@cindex padding the location counter given a power of two
@cindex @code{p2align} directive
Pad the location counter (in the current subsection) to a particular
storage boundary.  The first expression (which must be absolute) is the
number of low-order zero bits the location counter must have after
advancement.  For example @samp{.p2align 3} advances the location
counter until it a multiple of 8.  If the location counter is already a
multiple of 8, no change is needed.

The second expression (also absolute) gives the value to be stored in
the padding bytes.  It (and the comma) may be omitted.  If it is
omitted, the padding bytes are zero.

@cindex @code{p2alignw} directive
@cindex @code{p2alignl} directive
The @code{.p2alignw} and @code{.p2alignl} directives are variants of the
@code{.p2align} directive.  The @code{.p2alignw} directive treats the fill
pattern as a two byte word value.  The @code{.p2alignl} directives treats the
fill pattern as a four byte longword value.  For example, @code{.p2alignw
2,0x368d} will align to a multiple of 4.  If it skips two bytes, they will be
filled in with the value 0x368d (the exact placement of the bytes depends upon
the endianness of the processor).  If it skips 1 or 3 bytes, the fill value is
undefined.

@node Psize
@section @code{.psize @var{lines} , @var{columns}}

@cindex @code{psize} directive
@cindex listing control: paper size
@cindex paper size, for listings
Use this directive to declare the number of lines---and, optionally, the
number of columns---to use for each page, when generating listings.

If you do not use @code{.psize}, listings use a default line-count
of 60.  You may omit the comma and @var{columns} specification; the
default width is 200 columns.

@code{@value{AS}} generates formfeeds whenever the specified number of
lines is exceeded (or whenever you explicitly request one, using
@code{.eject}).

If you specify @var{lines} as @code{0}, no formfeeds are generated save
those explicitly specified with @code{.eject}.

@node Quad
@section @code{.quad @var{bignums}}

@cindex @code{quad} directive
@code{.quad} expects zero or more bignums, separated by commas.  For
each bignum, it emits
@ifclear bignum-16
an 8-byte integer.  If the bignum won't fit in 8 bytes, it prints a
warning message; and just takes the lowest order 8 bytes of the bignum.
@cindex eight-byte integer
@cindex integer, 8-byte

The term ``quad'' comes from contexts in which a ``word'' is two bytes;
hence @emph{quad}-word for 8 bytes.
@end ifclear
@ifset bignum-16
a 16-byte integer.  If the bignum won't fit in 16 bytes, it prints a
warning message; and just takes the lowest order 16 bytes of the bignum.
@cindex sixteen-byte integer
@cindex integer, 16-byte
@end ifset

@node Rept
@section @code{.rept @var{count}}

@cindex @code{rept} directive
Repeat the sequence of lines between the @code{.rept} directive and the next
@code{.endr} directive @var{count} times.

For example, assembling

@example
        .rept   3
        .long   0
        .endr
@end example

is equivalent to assembling

@example
        .long   0
        .long   0
        .long   0
@end example

@node Sbttl
@section @code{.sbttl "@var{subheading}"}

@cindex @code{sbttl} directive
@cindex subtitles for listings
@cindex listing control: subtitle

This directive affects subsequent pages, as well as the current page if
it appears within ten lines of the top of a page.

@ifset have-stabs
@node Stab
@section @code{.stabd, .stabn, .stabs}

@cindex symbolic debuggers, information for
@cindex @code{stab@var{x}} directives
There are three directives that begin @samp{.stab}.
All emit symbols (@pxref{Symbols}), for use by symbolic debuggers.
The symbols are not entered in the @code{@value{AS}} hash table: they
cannot be referenced elsewhere in the source file.
Up to five fields are required:

@table @var
@item string
This is the symbol's name.  It may contain any character except
@samp{\000}, so is more general than ordinary symbol names.  Some
debuggers used to code arbitrarily complex structures into symbol names
using this field.

@item type
An absolute expression.  The symbol's type is set to the low 8 bits of
this expression.  Any bit pattern is permitted, but @code{@value{LD}}
and debuggers choke on silly bit patterns.

@item other
An absolute expression.  The symbol's ``other'' attribute is set to the
low 8 bits of this expression.

@item desc
An absolute expression.  The symbol's descriptor is set to the low 16
bits of this expression.

@item value
An absolute expression which becomes the symbol's value.
@end table

If a warning is detected while reading a @code{.stabd}, @code{.stabn},
or @code{.stabs} statement, the symbol has probably already been created;
you get a half-formed symbol in your object file.  This is
compatible with earlier assemblers!

@table @code
@cindex @code{stabd} directive
@item .stabd @var{type} , @var{other} , @var{desc}

The ``name'' of the symbol generated is not even an empty string.
It is a null pointer, for compatibility.  Older assemblers used a
null pointer so they didn't waste space in object files with empty
strings.

The symbol's value is set to the location counter,
relocatably.  When your program is linked, the value of this symbol
is the address of the location counter when the @code{.stabd} was
assembled.

@cindex @code{stabn} directive
@item .stabn @var{type} , @var{other} , @var{desc} , @var{value}
The name of the symbol is set to the empty string @code{""}.

@cindex @code{stabs} directive

Machines with a 32-bit address space, but that do less than 32-bit

@pxref{Machine Dependencies}), you can ignore this issue.

@end ifset
In order to assemble compiler output into something that works,
@code{@value{AS}} occasionlly does strange things to @samp{.word} directives.
Directives of the form @samp{.word sym1-sym2} are often emitted by
compilers as part of jump tables.  Therefore, when @code{@value{AS}} assembles a
directive of the form @samp{.word sym1-sym2}, and the difference between
@code{sym1} and @code{sym2} does not fit in 16 bits, @code{@value{AS}}
creates a @dfn{secondary jump table}, immediately before the next label.
This secondary jump table is preceded by a short-jump to the
first byte after the secondary table.  This short-jump prevents the flow
of control from accidentally falling into the new table.  Inside the
table is a long-jump to @code{sym2}.  The original @samp{.word}
contains @code{sym1} minus the address of the long-jump to
@code{sym2}.

If there were several occurrences of @samp{.word sym1-sym2} before the
secondary jump table, all of them are adjusted.  If there was a
@samp{.word sym3-sym4}, that also did not fit in sixteen bits, a
long-jump to @code{sym4} is included in the secondary jump table,
and the @code{.word} directives are adjusted to contain @code{sym3}
minus the address of the long-jump to @code{sym4}; and so on, for as many
entries in the original jump table as necessary.

@chapter Machine Dependent Features

@cindex machine dependencies
The machine instruction sets are (almost by definition) different on
each machine where @code{@value{AS}} runs.  Floating point representations
vary as well, and @code{@value{AS}} often supports a few additional
directives or command-line options for compatibility with other
assemblers on a particular platform.  Finally, some versions of
@code{@value{AS}} support special pseudo-instructions for branch
optimization.

This chapter discusses most of these differences, though it does not
include details on any machine's instruction set.  For details on that
subject, see the hardware manufacturer's manual.

@c The following major nodes are *sections* in the GENERIC version, *chapters*
@c in single-cpu versions.  This is mainly achieved by @lowersections.  There is a
@c peculiarity: to preserve cross-references, there must be a node called
@c "Machine Dependencies".  Hence the conditional nodenames in each
@c major node below.  Node defaulting in makeinfo requires adjacency of
@c node and sectioning commands; hence the repetition of @chapter BLAH
@c in both conditional blocks.

@chapter Machine Dependent Features

The machine instruction sets are different on each Hitachi chip family,
and there are also some syntax differences among the families.  This
chapter describes the specific @code{@value{AS}} features for each
family.

@node Acknowledgements
@chapter Acknowledgements

If you have contributed to @code{@value{AS}} and your name isn't listed here,
it is not meant as a slight.  We just don't know about it.  Send mail to the
maintainer, and we'll correct the situation.  Currently 
@c (January 1994), 
the maintainer is Ken Raeburn (email address @code{raeburn@@cygnus.com}).

Dean Elsner wrote the original @sc{gnu} assembler for the VAX.@footnote{Any
more details?}

Jay Fenlason maintained GAS for a while, adding support for GDB-specific debug
information and the 68k series machines, most of the preprocessing pass, and
extensive changes in @file{messages.c}, @file{input-file.c}, @file{write.c}.

K. Richard Pixley maintained GAS for a while, adding various enhancements and
many bug fixes, including merging support for several processors, breaking GAS
up to handle multiple object file format back ends (including heavy rewrite,
testing, an integration of the coff and b.out back ends), adding configuration
including heavy testing and verification of cross assemblers and file splits
and renaming, converted GAS to strictly ANSI C including full prototypes, added
support for m680[34]0 and cpu32, did considerable work on i960 including a COFF
port (including considerable amounts of reverse engineering), a SPARC opcode
file rewrite, DECstation, rs6000, and hp300hpux host ports, updated ``know''
assertions and made them work, much other reorganization, cleanup, and lint.

Ken Raeburn wrote the high-level BFD interface code to replace most of the code
in format-specific I/O modules.

The original VMS support was contributed by David L. Kashtan.  Eric Youngdale
has done much work with it since.

The Intel 80386 machine description was written by Eliot Dresselhaus.

Minh Tran-Le at IntelliCorp contributed some AIX 386 support.

The Motorola 88k machine description was contributed by Devon Bowen of Buffalo
University and Torbjorn Granlund of the Swedish Institute of Computer Science.

Keith Knowles at the Open Software Foundation wrote the original MIPS back end
(@file{tc-mips.c}, @file{tc-mips.h}), and contributed Rose format support
(which hasn't been merged in yet).  Ralph Campbell worked with the MIPS code to
support a.out format.

Support for the Zilog Z8k and Hitachi H8/300 and H8/500 processors (tc-z8k,
tc-h8300, tc-h8500), and IEEE 695 object file format (obj-ieee), was written by
Steve Chamberlain of Cygnus Support.  Steve also modified the COFF back end to
use BFD for some low-level operations, for use with the H8/300 and AMD 29k
targets.

John Gilmore built the AMD 29000 support, added @code{.include} support, and
simplified the configuration of which versions accept which directives.  He
updated the 68k machine description so that Motorola's opcodes always produced
fixed-size instructions (e.g. @code{jsr}), while synthetic instructions
remained shrinkable (@code{jbsr}).  John fixed many bugs, including true tested
cross-compilation support, and one bug in relaxation that took a week and
required the proverbial one-bit fix.

Ian Lance Taylor of Cygnus Support merged the Motorola and MIT syntax for the
68k, completed support for some COFF targets (68k, i386 SVR3, and SCO Unix),
added support for MIPS ECOFF and ELF targets, wrote the initial RS/6000 and
PowerPC assembler, and made a few other minor patches.

Steve Chamberlain made @code{@value{AS}} able to generate listings.

Hewlett-Packard contributed support for the HP9000/300.

Jeff Law wrote GAS and BFD support for the native HPPA object format (SOM)
along with a fairly extensive HPPA testsuite (for both SOM and ELF object
formats).  This work was supported by both the Center for Software Science at
the University of Utah and Cygnus Support.

Support for ELF format files has been worked on by Mark Eichin of Cygnus
Support (original, incomplete implementation for SPARC), Pete Hoogenboom and
Jeff Law at the University of Utah (HPPA mainly), Michael Meissner of the Open
Software Foundation (i386 mainly), and Ken Raeburn of Cygnus Support (sparc,
and some initial 64-bit support).

Richard Henderson rewrote the Alpha assembler.

Several engineers at Cygnus Support have also provided many small bug fixes and
configuration enhancements.

Many others have contributed large or small bugfixes and enhancements.  If
you have contributed significant work and are not mentioned on this list, and
want to be, let us know.  Some of the history has been lost; we are not
intentionally leaving anyone out.
