Opcodes
-------

   For detailed information on the SH machine instruction set, see
`SH-Microcomputer User's Manual' (Hitachi Micro Systems, Inc.).

   `as' implements all the standard SH opcodes.  No additional
pseudo-instructions are needed on this family.  Note, however, that
because `as' supports a simpler form of PC-relative addressing, you may
simply write (for example)

     mov.l  bar,r0

where other assemblers might require an explicit displacement to `bar'
from the program counter:

     mov.l  @(DISP, PC)

   Here is a summary of SH opcodes:

Options
-------

   The SPARC chip family includes several successive levels, using the
same core instruction set, but including a few additional instructions
at each level.  There are exceptions to this however.  For details on
what instructions each variant supports, please see the chip's
architecture reference manual.

   By default, `as' assumes the core instruction set (SPARC v6), but
"bumps" the architecture level as needed: it switches to successively
higher architectures as it encounters instructions that only exist in
the higher levels.

   If not configured for SPARC v9 (`sparc64-*-*') GAS will not bump
passed sparclite by default, an option must be passed to enable the v9
instructions.

   GAS treats sparclite as being compatible with v8, unless an
architecture is explicitly requested.  SPARC v9 is always incompatible
with sparclite.

`-Av6 | -Av7 | -Av8 | -Asparclet | -Asparclite | -Av9 | -Av9a'
     Use one of the `-A' options to select one of the SPARC
     architectures explicitly.  If you select an architecture
     explicitly, `as' reports a fatal error if it encounters an
     instruction or feature requiring a higher level.

`-xarch=v8plus | -xarch=v8plusa'
     For compatibility with the Solaris v9 assembler.  These options are
     equivalent to -Av9 and -Av9a, respectively.

`-bump'
     Warn whenever it is necessary to switch to another level.  If an
     architecture level is explicitly requested, GAS will not issue
     warnings until that level is reached, and will then bump the level
     as required (except between incompatible levels).

Sparc Machine Directives
------------------------

   The Sparc version of `as' supports the following additional machine
directives:

`.align'
     This must be followed by the desired alignment in bytes.

`.common'
     This must be followed by a symbol name, a positive number, and
     `"bss"'.  This behaves somewhat like `.comm', but the syntax is
     different.

`.half'
     This is functionally identical to `.short'.

`.proc'
     This directive is ignored.  Any text following it on the same line
     is also ignored.

`.reserve'
     This must be followed by a symbol name, a positive number, and
     `"bss"'.  This behaves somewhat like `.lcomm', but the syntax is
     different.

`.seg'
     This must be followed by `"text"', `"data"', or `"data1"'.  It
     behaves like `.text', `.data', or `.data 1'.

`.skip'
     This is functionally identical to the `.space' directive.

`.word'
     On the Sparc, the `.word' directive produces 32 bit values,
     instead of the 16 bit values it produces on many other machines.

`.xword'
     On the Sparc V9 processor, the `.xword' directive produces 64 bit
     values.

Z8000 Dependent Features
========================

   The Z8000 as supports both members of the Z8000 family: the
unsegmented Z8002, with 16 bit addresses, and the segmented Z8001 with
24 bit addresses.

   When the assembler is in unsegmented mode (specified with the
`unsegm' directive), an address takes up one word (16 bit) sized
register.  When the assembler is in segmented mode (specified with the
`segm' directive), a 24-bit address takes up a long (32 bit) register.

Register Names
..............

   The Z8000 has sixteen 16 bit registers, numbered 0 to 15.  You can
refer to different sized groups of registers by register number, with
the prefix `r' for 16 bit registers, `rr' for 32 bit registers and `rq'
for 64 bit registers.  You can also refer to the contents of the first
eight (of the sixteen 16 bit registers) by bytes.  They are named `rNh'
and `rNl'.

Addressing Modes
................

   as understands the following addressing modes for the Z8000:

`rN'
     Register direct

`@rN'
     Indirect register

`ADDR'
     Direct: the 16 bit or 24 bit address (depending on whether the
     assembler is in segmented or unsegmented mode) of the operand is
     in the instruction.

`address(rN)'
     Indexed: the 16 or 24 bit address is added to the 16 bit register
     to produce the final address in memory of the operand.

`rN(#IMM)'
     Base Address: the 16 or 24 bit register is added to the 16 bit sign
     extended immediate displacement to produce the final address in
     memory of the operand.

`rN(rM)'
     Base Index: the 16 or 24 bit register rN is added to the sign
     extended 16 bit index register rM to produce the final address in
     memory of the operand.

`#XX'
     Immediate data XX.

Assembler Directives for the Z8000
----------------------------------

   The Z8000 port of as includes these additional assembler directives,
for compatibility with other Z8000 assemblers.  As shown, these do not
begin with `.' (unlike the ordinary as directives).

`segm'
     Generates code for the segmented Z8001.

`unsegm'
     Generates code for the unsegmented Z8002.

`name'
     Synonym for `.file'

`global'
     Synonym for `.global'

`wval'
     Synonym for `.word'

`lval'
     Synonym for `.long'

`bval'
     Synonym for `.byte'

`sval'
     Assemble a string.  `sval' expects one string literal, delimited by
     single quotes.  It assembles each byte of the string into
     consecutive addresses.  You can use the escape sequence `%XX'
     (where XX represents a two-digit hexadecimal number) to represent
     the character whose ASCII value is XX.  Use this feature to
     describe single quote and other characters that may not appear in
     string literals as themselves.  For example, the C statement
     `char *a = "he said \"it's 50% off\"";' is represented in Z8000
     assembly language (shown with the assembler output in hex at the
     left) as

          68652073    sval    'he said %22it%27s 50%25 off%22%00'
          61696420
          22697427
          73203530
          25206F66
          662200

`rsect'
     synonym for `.section'

`block'
     synonym for `.space'

`even'
     special case of `.align'; aligns output to even byte boundary.

VAX Command-Line Options
------------------------

   The Vax version of `as' accepts any of the following options, gives
a warning message that the option was ignored and proceeds.  These
options are for compatibility with scripts designed for other people's
assemblers.

``-D' (Debug)'
``-S' (Symbol Table)'
``-T' (Token Trace)'
     These are obsolete options used to debug old assemblers.

``-d' (Displacement size for JUMPs)'
     This option expects a number following the `-d'.  Like options
     that expect filenames, the number may immediately follow the `-d'
     (old standard) or constitute the whole of the command line
     argument that follows `-d' (GNU standard).

``-V' (Virtualize Interpass Temporary File)'
     Some other assemblers use a temporary file.  This option commanded
     them to keep the information in active memory rather than in a
     disk file.  `as' always does this, so this option is redundant.

``-J' (JUMPify Longer Branches)'
     Many 32-bit computers permit a variety of branch instructions to
     do the same job.  Some of these instructions are short (and fast)
     but have a limited range; others are long (and slow) but can
     branch anywhere in virtual memory.  Often there are 3 flavors of
     branch: short, medium and long.  Some other assemblers would emit
     short and medium branches, unless told by this option to emit
     short and long branches.

``-t' (Temporary File Directory)'
     Some other assemblers may use a temporary file, and this option
     takes a filename being the directory to site the temporary file.
     Since `as' does not use a temporary disk file, this option makes
     no difference.  `-t' needs exactly one filename.

   The Vax version of the assembler accepts two options when compiled
for VMS.  They are `-h', and `-+'.  The `-h' option prevents `as' from
modifying the symbol-table entries for symbols that contain lowercase
characters (I think).  The `-+' option causes `as' to print warning
messages if the FILENAME part of the object file, or any symbol name is
larger than 31 characters.  The `-+' option also inserts some code
following the `_main' symbol so that the object file is compatible with
Vax-11 "C".

VAX Floating Point
------------------

   Conversion of flonums to floating point is correct, and compatible
with previous assemblers.  Rounding is towards zero if the remainder is
exactly half the least significant bit.

   `D', `F', `G' and `H' floating point formats are understood.

   Immediate floating literals (*e.g.* `S`$6.9') are rendered
correctly.  Again, rounding is towards zero in the boundary case.

   The `.float' directive produces `f' format numbers.  The `.double'
directive produces `d' format numbers.


File: as.info,  Node: VAX-directives,  Next: VAX-opcodes,  Prev: VAX-float,  Up: Vax-Dependent

Vax Machine Directives
----------------------

   The Vax version of the assembler supports four directives for
generating Vax floating point constants.  They are described in the
table below.

`.dfloat'
     This expects zero or more flonums, separated by commas, and
     assembles Vax `d' format 64-bit floating point constants.

`.ffloat'
     This expects zero or more flonums, separated by commas, and
     assembles Vax `f' format 32-bit floating point constants.

`.gfloat'
     This expects zero or more flonums, separated by commas, and
     assembles Vax `g' format 64-bit floating point constants.

`.hfloat'
     This expects zero or more flonums, separated by commas, and
     assembles Vax `h' format 128-bit floating point constants.


File: as.info,  Node: VAX-opcodes,  Next: VAX-branch,  Prev: VAX-directives,  Up: Vax-Dependent

VAX Opcodes
-----------

   All DEC mnemonics are supported.  Beware that `case...' instructions
have exactly 3 operands.  The dispatch table that follows the `case...'
instruction should be made with `.word' statements.  This is compatible
with all unix assemblers we know of.


File: as.info,  Node: VAX-branch,  Next: VAX-operands,  Prev: VAX-opcodes,  Up: Vax-Dependent

VAX Branch Improvement
----------------------

   Certain pseudo opcodes are permitted.  They are for branch
instructions.  They expand to the shortest branch instruction that
reaches the target.  Generally these mnemonics are made by substituting
`j' for `b' at the start of a DEC mnemonic.  This feature is included
both for compatibility and to help compilers.  If you do not need this
feature, avoid these opcodes.  Here are the mnemonics, and the code
they can expand into.

`jbsb'
     `Jsb' is already an instruction mnemonic, so we chose `jbsb'.
    (byte displacement)
          `bsbb ...'

    (word displacement)
          `bsbw ...'

    (long displacement)
          `jsb ...'

`jbr'
`jr'
     Unconditional branch.
    (byte displacement)
          `brb ...'

    (word displacement)
          `brw ...'

    (long displacement)
          `jmp ...'

`jCOND'
     COND may be any one of the conditional branches `neq', `nequ',
     `eql', `eqlu', `gtr', `geq', `lss', `gtru', `lequ', `vc', `vs',
     `gequ', `cc', `lssu', `cs'.  COND may also be one of the bit tests
     `bs', `bc', `bss', `bcs', `bsc', `bcc', `bssi', `bcci', `lbs',
     `lbc'.  NOTCOND is the opposite condition to COND.
    (byte displacement)
          `bCOND ...'

    (word displacement)
          `bNOTCOND foo ; brw ... ; foo:'

    (long displacement)

`jacbX'
     X may be one of `b d f g h l w'.

          `OPCODE ...'

    (long displacement)
               OPCODE ..., foo ;
               brb bar ;
               foo: jmp ... ;
               bar:

`jaobYYY'
     YYY may be one of `lss leq'.

`jsobZZZ'
     ZZZ may be one of `geq gtr'.
    (byte displacement)
          `OPCODE ...'

    (word displacement)

VAX Operands
------------

   The immediate character is `$' for Unix compatibility, not `#' as
DEC writes it.

   The indirect character is `*' for Unix compatibility, not `@' as DEC
writes it.

   The displacement sizing character is ``' (an accent grave) for Unix
compatibility, not `^' as DEC writes it.  The letter preceding ``' may
have either case.  `G' is not understood, but all other letters (`b i l
s w') are understood.

   Register names understood are `r0 r1 r2 ... r15 ap fp sp pc'.  Upper
and lower case letters are equivalent.

   For instance
     tstb *w`$4(r5)

   Any expression is permitted in an operand.  Operands are comma
separated.

`input-file.c', `write.c'.

   K. Richard Pixley maintained GAS for a while, adding various
enhancements and many bug fixes, including merging support for several
processors, breaking GAS up to handle multiple object file format back
ends (including heavy rewrite, testing, an integration of the coff and
b.out back ends), adding configuration including heavy testing and
verification of cross assemblers and file splits and renaming,
converted GAS to strictly ANSI C including full prototypes, added
support for m680[34]0 and cpu32, did considerable work on i960
including a COFF port (including considerable amounts of reverse
engineering), a SPARC opcode file rewrite, DECstation, rs6000, and
hp300hpux host ports, updated "know" assertions and made them work,
much other reorganization, cleanup, and lint.

   Ken Raeburn wrote the high-level BFD interface code to replace most
of the code in format-specific I/O modules.

   The original VMS support was contributed by David L. Kashtan.  Eric
Youngdale has done much work with it since.

   The Intel 80386 machine description was written by Eliot Dresselhaus.

   Minh Tran-Le at IntelliCorp contributed some AIX 386 support.

   The Motorola 88k machine description was contributed by Devon Bowen
of Buffalo University and Torbjorn Granlund of the Swedish Institute of
Computer Science.

   Keith Knowles at the Open Software Foundation wrote the original
MIPS back end (`tc-mips.c', `tc-mips.h'), and contributed Rose format
support (which hasn't been merged in yet).  Ralph Campbell worked with
the MIPS code to support a.out format.

   Support for the Zilog Z8k and Hitachi H8/300 and H8/500 processors
(tc-z8k, tc-h8300, tc-h8500), and IEEE 695 object file format
(obj-ieee), was written by Steve Chamberlain of Cygnus Support.  Steve
also modified the COFF back end to use BFD for some low-level
operations, for use with the H8/300 and AMD 29k targets.

   John Gilmore built the AMD 29000 support, added `.include' support,
and simplified the configuration of which versions accept which
directives.  He updated the 68k machine description so that Motorola's
opcodes always produced fixed-size instructions (e.g. `jsr'), while
synthetic instructions remained shrinkable (`jbsr').  John fixed many
bugs, including true tested cross-compilation support, and one bug in
relaxation that took a week and required the proverbial one-bit fix.

   Ian Lance Taylor of Cygnus Support merged the Motorola and MIT
syntax for the 68k, completed support for some COFF targets (68k, i386
SVR3, and SCO Unix), added support for MIPS ECOFF and ELF targets,
wrote the initial RS/6000 and PowerPC assembler, and made a few other
minor patches.

   Steve Chamberlain made `as' able to generate listings.

   Hewlett-Packard contributed support for the HP9000/300.

   Jeff Law wrote GAS and BFD support for the native HPPA object format
(SOM) along with a fairly extensive HPPA testsuite (for both SOM and
ELF object formats).  This work was supported by both the Center for
Software Science at the University of Utah and Cygnus Support.

   Support for ELF format files has been worked on by Mark Eichin of
Cygnus Support (original, incomplete implementation for SPARC), Pete
Hoogenboom and Jeff Law at the University of Utah (HPPA mainly),
Michael Meissner of the Open Software Foundation (i386 mainly), and Ken
Raeburn of Cygnus Support (sparc, and some initial 64-bit support).

   Richard Henderson rewrote the Alpha assembler.

   Several engineers at Cygnus Support have also provided many small
bug fixes and configuration enhancements.

   Many others have contributed large or small bugfixes and
enhancements.  If you have contributed significant work and are not
mentioned on this list, and want to be, let us know.  Some of the
history has been lost; we are not intentionally leaving anyone out.
